            If you've ever Googled "how do I get press for my startup?", felt overwhelmed, opened Twitter and immediately felt a bit sick, this is for you.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Because Twitter is where journalists actually ask for things. And when you first realise that, it's slightly overwhelming. Requests flying past, deadlines attached, replies piling up underneath, and no real clue what you're meant to say or how fast you're meant to say it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That's how I ended up there in the first place. I wasn't trying to become good at PR. I was just trying to get coverage for my own business and Twitter kept being where the action was. So I stayed. I watched. I replied. I missed things. I got ignored. Then occasionally, something landed and I'd think, oh, that worked.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            I started noticing patterns! Replies that were too long went nowhere. Replies that got straight to the point sometimes did. Some journalists wanted a DM, some didn't, and some only replied if you caught them almost straight away! None of that is written down anywhere. You only learn it by trial and error!
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Before long, Twitter was just open all the time. UK journalists in the morning, US later on, Australia at night. It wasn't glamorous and it definitely wasn't planned. It was just repetition. And repetition eventually turns into pattern.

              src="/assets/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050316_1763395875996.jpg"

              className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6"

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This isn't something I understood straight away. It's just something I noticed over time.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Journalists don't sit down at the start of the week with a neat list of everything they're going to write. Things change. Stories shift. Deadlines move. Sometimes they're halfway through writing something and realise they need a real person, a quote, or a specific example, and they need it quickly.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Twitter is the easiest place for that.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              It's public, it's fast, and it doesn't require much effort. A journalist can post a request in under a minute and immediately see who responds. No inbox management, no back-and-forth, no waiting days for replies.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              That's why the requests you see on Twitter are usually very specific. They're not vague fishing exercises. They tend to come with details, deadlines, and sometimes even word counts. When someone posts one of these, it's usually because they're already working on the piece and trying to fill a gap.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Once I realised that, the whole thing felt less intimidating. I stopped thinking of Twitter as a place where you "pitch ideas" and more as a place where you answer questions. If I could genuinely help with what they were asking for, I replied. If I couldn't, I didn't.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This is also why timing matters so much. These requests don't sit around for hours. A journalist might only be watching replies for a short window before they've got what they need and move on.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
              <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
                It's one of the reasons I eventually built ContactJournalists.com. After years of doing this manually, I knew how easy it was to miss good opportunities simply because you weren't looking at the right moment. The platform surfaces journalist requests as they happen, so you can decide quickly whether you're relevant and respond while it still makes sense to do so. There's a 7-day free trial, so you can see how it fits into your routine without committing.
              </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Once you understand why journalists use Twitter this way, pitching becomes much less about confidence and much more about paying attention.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Next, it helps to understand how these requests actually work and just how fast they move.

            <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">How Journalist Requests Actually Work (and How Fast They Move)</h2>

            <img
              src="/assets/stock_images/journalist_working_o_96027d3b.jpg"
              alt="Journalist working on story"

            />

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              One of the biggest surprises when you first start paying attention to journalist requests on Twitter is just how quickly they fill up.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              A journalist can post a request and have enough replies within minutes. Sometimes even less. You might still be typing a thoughtful response while ten other people have already replied underneath.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Most journalists aren't sitting there all day monitoring replies. They'll check the thread, pick a handful of relevant responses, and move on. Once they've got what they need, that request is effectively closed, even if the tweet is still sitting there.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This is why you'll sometimes see people replying hours later and getting nowhere. It's not that their pitch is bad. It's just late.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Another thing people don't always realise is that journalists often already know roughly what they're looking for. They're not browsing replies for inspiration. They're scanning for someone who fits the brief quickly and clearly. If they can tell within a few seconds that you're relevant, you've got a chance.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This is also where overthinking really works against you. Long replies take time to read, and time is exactly what journalists don't have when they post these requests. Clear, short responses tend to stand out simply because they're easier to process.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Once I understood how fast these threads moved, I stopped trying to write perfect replies. I focused on being clear and quick instead. That shift alone made a noticeable difference.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              It also made me realise how easy it is to miss good opportunities if you're not watching constantly. Unless Twitter is open in front of you at the right moment, you won't even see most of these requests, let alone respond in time.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              That's why tools matter here. Not to automate replies or spam journalists, but to make sure you actually see the opportunity while it's still relevant.
            </p>

            />

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This is the bit people usually overthink.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              When you see a journalist request, it's tempting to explain everything. Your background, your business, why you're interesting, why they should pick you. I did that at the start, and it almost never worked.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              What helped was realising that a journalist is scanning replies, not reading them properly. They're looking for quick signals that you're relevant. If they can't see that straight away, they move on.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              So the goal isn't to impress them. It's to make it obvious, quickly, that you fit what they're asking for.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              If a journalist is looking for a founder who's bootstrapped a business, say that. If they want someone in a specific industry, lead with that. You don't need to sell yourself. You just need to answer the question they've asked.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Short replies tend to work better than long ones. Not because long replies are bad, but because they take longer to process. A clear sentence or two is usually enough to get a follow-up or a DM.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              There's also no need to add links straight away unless they ask for them. Dropping a website, LinkedIn, and three extra details can actually slow things down. Most of the time, if they're interested, they'll ask for more.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              What doesn't work is replying vaguely. Things like "happy to help" or "would love to chat" don't give a journalist anything to work with. They still have to guess whether you're relevant, and guessing is effort.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Another mistake I made early on was trying to sound clever or polished. That's not what journalists are looking for here. They want someone real, who can give them what they need quickly and reliably.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              If you're relevant, say why. If you're not, don't reply. It sounds obvious, but skipping irrelevant requests is just as important as replying to the right ones.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              If this part feels uncomfortable at first, that's normal. It gets easier very quickly once you've done it a few times and seen what actually gets responses.
            </p>

              This was a hard one for me to accept at first, because it goes against how most of us think things should work.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              You assume the better written reply wins. The smarter angle. The most polished response. But on Twitter, especially with journalist requests, that's often not the case.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Most of the time, the reply that gets picked is simply the one that arrives early and makes sense.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Journalists are usually working to a deadline when they post these requests. They don't have the time or headspace to compare twenty thoughtful replies side by side. They skim. They pick a few people who clearly fit. And then they move on.

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              That doesn't mean quality doesn't matter at all. It does. But it only matters after you've been seen. If your reply comes in too late, it doesn't matter how good it is.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I learned this the frustrating way. I'd spend time writing a careful response, hit send, and then realise the thread was already full. Other times I'd reply quickly, almost casually, and get a follow-up within minutes. That was a big mindset shift.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Speed doesn't mean being sloppy. It just means not overthinking the first message. You're not writing the article for them. You're just signalling that you're relevant and available.

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This is also why these opportunities feel random if you're only checking Twitter occasionally. You can be the perfect fit and still miss it simply because you weren't looking at the right moment.

              Next, let's look at when it makes sense to reply publicly and when it's better to move things into DMs.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Public vs DM */}
          <section id="public-vs-dm" className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">When to Reply Publicly vs When to Send a DM</h2>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This is something that confused me early on, and I see founders get wrong all the time. There isn't one "right" way to do it. It depends on what the journalist has asked for and how they usually work.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-6">Reply Publicly When:</h3>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              If a journalist explicitly says "reply here" or posts a public request with a clear brief, replying publicly is usually the safest option. It lets them quickly scan who's relevant without opening their inbox, and it shows you're following instructions, which matters more than people realise.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Public replies also work well when the request is broad. If they're looking for founders, customers, case studies, or general experiences, a short public reply is often enough to get their attention. If they're interested, they'll move the conversation into DMs themselves.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-6">Send a DM When:</h3>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              DMs tend to make more sense when a journalist asks for them directly, or when the request is more sensitive. If they're asking for personal experiences, financial details, or anything that feels awkward to share publicly, a DM is usually more appropriate.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              What doesn't tend to work is jumping straight into DMs without being invited. I did this early on, thinking I was being proactive, and it rarely landed well. For some journalists, unsolicited DMs feel intrusive, especially if they've asked for public replies.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Another thing I learned is that journalists are very individual. Some always prefer DMs. Some almost never use them. Over time, you start to recognise patterns with certain names and accounts, but that only comes with repetition.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              If you're unsure, default to whatever they've asked for in the tweet. It sounds obvious, but a surprising number of people ignore that part and then wonder why they don't get a response.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This is another area where seeing lots of requests helps. When you watch how different journalists phrase things and how they respond, you get a feel for what's normal and what isn't. It becomes instinctive.
            </p>

              className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6"
            />

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I made pretty much every mistake you can make with this, which is partly why I'm so opinionated about what actually works!
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              One of the first mistakes was replying to things that weren't really a fit. In the beginning, I'd convince myself I could make almost any request work for my business. I couldn't. All it did was waste time and occasionally annoy people. If you're stretching to explain why you're relevant, you probably aren't.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Having said that, there are exceptions, and this is where paying attention really matters! Not just to what a journalist is asking for, but how they're asking for it. Tone tells you a lot.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I remember a fitness and health journalist putting out a request for a mountain bike, joking that he'd "guard it with his life". On paper, that had nothing to do with my business. But the tone was playful, and it was obvious he wasn't being overly serious. I replied in the same spirit, mentioning my supplements rather than pretending I had a bike to offer.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Nothing came of it immediately. No reply. No feature. But we stayed on each other's radar. And about six months later, that same journalist featured my brand in Forbes!
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              That experience stuck with me. It showed me the difference between forcing relevance and reading the room. If the tone is right and the connection feels natural, sometimes it's okay to bend the rules slightly. But if you're having to work too hard to justify why you belong in the conversation, it's usually a sign to skip it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Another mistake I made early on was overexplaining. I thought more detail would help. It didn't. It just made replies harder to read. Journalists don't need your full backstory upfront. They need to know, quickly, whether you fit what they're asking for.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I also spent too long trying to get the wording perfect. I'd tweak replies, re-read them, hesitate, and by the time I hit send, the opportunity was often gone. That was frustrating, especially when I knew I was a good fit!
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              There was a phase where I thought adding links would make things easier. Website, LinkedIn, press page, all in one reply. That rarely helped. Most journalists will ask for a link if they want one.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I didn't always take deadlines seriously enough either. If a journalist said they needed something by a certain time, I sometimes assumed replying a bit later wouldn't matter. It did.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Probably the biggest mistake, though, was treating this like a numbers game. Replying to lots of requests instead of the right ones. Once I slowed down and focused on relevance, the quality of responses improved almost immediately!
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              If you recognise yourself in any of this, that's normal. Everyone does it at the start. The difference comes from noticing what isn't working and adjusting.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">How I Handled Different Time Zones Without Burning Out</h2>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              This wasn't strategic. At all.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Journalists post when they're working. That's it. So once I started paying attention, requests were coming in all the time. UK in the morning. US later. Australia at night. There wasn't some clever schedule. Twitter was just… open.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              At the start, I tried to catch everything - which was a HUGE mistake. You don't need to reply to everything, and you definitely don't need to reply to things that aren't a good fit just because you happen to be awake.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              What actually helped was being picky. If something was genuinely right for my business, I'd reply. If it wasn't, I let it go. Even if I saw it at the "perfect" time. That took a bit of discipline, but it stopped it feeling endless.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I also stopped sitting there continuously refreshing - I'd check, reply if it made sense, then close it again. You don't need Twitter open constantly for this to work, even though it can feel like you do at the beginning.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Doing it manually is still extremely draining though and once I sold It Really Works Vitamins that's why I built ContactJournalists.com in the first place. I wanted to see requests as they happened without having to live on Twitter or think about time zones at all. There's a 7-day free trial, which lets you see pretty quickly whether that makes life easier.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">

            <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Why Most Founders Miss Press Opportunities Completely</h2>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Most founders don't miss press because they're bad at pitching. They miss it because they don't even see the opportunity in the first place.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              That's the bit no one really talks about.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Journalist requests move fast, and unless you're already looking at the right moment, they're gone before you've even opened Twitter. You can be a perfect fit and still miss it completely just because you were in a meeting, doing school pick-up, or, you know, running an actual business.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              The other big reason is hesitation. Founders see a request, think oh that could be me, then start second-guessing it. Is this relevant enough? Am I interesting enough? What should I say? By the time they've talked themselves into replying, the window has closed.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I did this too. A lot.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Another thing I see all the time is people waiting until they feel "ready". Like there's going to be a moment where you suddenly feel qualified enough to reply to journalists. That moment doesn't really come. You just get better by replying, seeing what happens, and adjusting.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              There's also a fear of getting it wrong publicly. Twitter feels exposed. Everyone can see your reply. But honestly, journalists aren't analysing your wording the way you are. They're just looking for someone who fits and can help them quickly.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              And then there's the practical side. Even if you do understand how this works, keeping up with requests manually is hard. They're scattered, they're time-sensitive, and they don't wait for you.
            </p>

              I built ContactJournalists.com because I was completely fatigued.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I was running a business, doing everything founders do, dealing with suppliers, customers, cash flow, logistics, emails, decisions, all of it. My head was constantly spinning. And on top of that, I was trying to get as much publicity as I could, because I knew how important it was.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">

              I'd be half-focused on work, half-watching Twitter, thinking I should check in case a journalist had posted something relevant. Then I'd check too late. Or I'd see something and not have the energy to deal with it properly. It felt chaotic.

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">

              ContactJournalists.com lets you do that side of things too.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              You can search for and reach out to journalists, bloggers, podcasters, and newsletter owners in your field, without guessing who to contact or spending hours trying to piece it together yourself. That part used to take me forever when I was doing this manually, and it was usually the bit that stopped me reaching out at all.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              What I like about combining both approaches is that they feed into each other. Responding to live requests helps you understand what people are writing about right now. Proactive outreach then becomes much more natural, because you're not pitching blindly, you're reaching out with something relevant.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Some weeks you'll respond to a request and land coverage quickly. Other weeks you'll quietly reach out to a handful of people you genuinely want to build a relationship with. Both matter, and both add up over time.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              The platform is there to support that whole process, not just the reactive side. Whether you're replying to a journalist who needs something today, or reaching out to someone you'd love to work with in the future, it gives you the visibility and context to do it without it feeling overwhelming.

                That's also why the 7-day free trial is useful. You can see the live requests coming in, explore the outreach side, and work out which approach makes sense for you right now.

              If you take anything away from this, let it be this: getting press isn't about being loud, polished, or confident. It's about being relevant, paying attention, and showing up at the right moment.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Twitter works for pitching journalists because it's real-time. You're not guessing what someone might want, they're telling you. The tricky part is seeing those opportunities before they disappear and knowing how to respond without overthinking it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              I learned all of this the slow way. By being on Twitter far too much. By missing opportunities. By getting ignored. By occasionally getting it right and then figuring out why. It worked, but it was exhausting, and it didn't need to be.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              That's why I built ContactJournalists.com.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
              Not to turn founders into PR people. Not to replace common sense. Just to make it easier to spot opportunities, respond while they still matter, and reach out to the right journalists, bloggers, podcasters, and newsletter owners in your space without everything feeling chaotic.

                If you're curious, try it properly. There's a 7-day free trial, and that's intentional. Use it to watch how journalist requests actually work, reply to a couple that genuinely fit, explore the outreach side, and see whether this makes getting press feel calmer rather than overwhelming.

              And if nothing else, I hope this post makes pitching journalists feel a bit less intimidating. It's not a dark art. It's just a skill you build by paying attention.
