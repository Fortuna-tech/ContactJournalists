          <h2>How Do I Get Press Coverage Without a PR Agency?</h2>

          <p>
            You're probably reading this with far too many tabs open, Stripe sitting there in the background, Slack pinging away, half-written emails you meant to send last week, and a Google search along the lines of "how do I get press coverage without a PR agency" because it's been on your list for a while and you know it matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know exactly where you are, because a few years ago, I was you!
          </p>

          <p>
            My name is Fortuna and I founded <a href="https://www.itreallyworksvitamins.com" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It Really Works Vitamins</a>, and like most founders, I was building it from scratch and trying to grow it properly without burning out or burning through my savings.I was juggling suppliers, marketing, customer emails, admin, and all the invisible work that comes with running a business. There was no big marketing team, no luxury PR budget, and no spare time. Just a product I really believed in and the constant feeling that I needed to be everywhere at once!!
          </p>

          <p>
            Without an agency, we managed to get featured in Forbes, Shortlist, Coach Mag and many others. Seeing something I'd created getting featured in the press was so exciting, but what mattered more was what happened afterwards: Sales growth reflected all the new people who'd suddenly heard about me, and the business really started to have momentum behind it!
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want to get press without hiring a PR agency, this is exactly why I built ContactJournalists.com.
          </p>

          <p>
            It gives founders access to real journalist opportunities, clear outreach tools, and a simple way to manage press without spreadsheets or retainers.

          <p>
            You're a founder with a huge amount of competing things on your to-do list, your budget is tight, you're growing your business, outsourcing where you can, managing your team, and if you are the team, you're handling all the paperwork too. All of that sits alongside home life, responsibilities, and maybe even trying to squeeze in a decent night's sleep. It's a fun challenge, but it's a lot for most people.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you put your marketing hat on, press feels like the obvious next step. You're probably figuring out how to get your SaaS into TechCrunch, your beauty brand into Marie Claire, or your boutique featured in Cosmo. Press features are the way forward, but the big question is always the same. How exactly do you get them, especially without paying a PR agency thousands every month?
          </p>

          <p>
            That's what this guide is here to explain.

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Why Press Coverage Still Works in 2025</h2>

          <img
            src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504711434969-e33886168f5c?w=600&h=300&fit=crop"

            className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6"
          />

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            In a world of noisy influencers being paid to feature things and ads that interrupt your reading, scrolling, and videos, it's easy to assume press doesn't matter anymore.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            In reality, press is still doing something most other channels can't.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            It builds trust before someone ever lands on your website.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When a publication features your business, it isn't just mentioning you, it's introducing you to exactly the right audience. That publication has already done the filtering for you. Their readers trust them, and that trust carries over to you. In effect, the publication is putting its seal of approval on your brand.
          </p>

          <img
            src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557804506-669a67965ba0?w=400&h=250&fit=crop"
            alt="Psychology concept illustration showing trust and authority"
            className="float-left mr-6 mb-4 w-48 h-32 object-cover rounded-lg"
          />

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When someone discovers your brand through an ad, they're starting cold. They don't know you, they don't trust you, and subconsciously they're looking for reasons not to buy. Press flips that dynamic completely. By the time someone clicks through from a publication, or Googles you after seeing your name mentioned, they already believe you're legitimate.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            I absolutely love Psychology Today, and since reading more about things like confirmation bias and authority bias, I keep noticing it everywhere. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. Being recommended a brand by a magazine or publication you genuinely love feels just as reassuring as word of mouth from a friend. That trusted third party has already done the hard work for you, and your brain fills in the rest.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That's exactly what press does for your brand. It doesn't interrupt people or try to convince them. It introduces you with credibility already attached!
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            I also saw this play out very clearly when I was running <a href="https://www.itreallyworksvitamins.com" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It Really Works Vitamins</a>. After being featured in Forbes, Men's Health, and Men's Fitness, I started using their logos across our marketing, particularly on social media. The difference was noticeable. Posts and ads that included those publication logos consistently encouraged far more visits than content without them. People stopped scrolling, clicked through more confidently, and explored the brand properly. That visual signal of trust made a real, measurable difference.
          </p>

          <h3>Press Reaches the Right People, Not Just More People</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            One of the most overlooked benefits of press coverage is relevance.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When your brand appears in a publication, you're not shouting into the void. You're being placed directly in front of people who already care about that topic. A SaaS founder reading a tech publication, a beauty customer browsing a fashion or lifestyle magazine, or a niche shopper reading a specialist site is already primed to be interested.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You're not interrupting them, you're meeting them where they already are.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That relevance leads to higher-quality traffic, stronger engagement, and a much better chance of conversion.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">

          <h3>Press Strengthens SEO in a Way Ads Never Will</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Press coverage doesn't disappear when the budget runs out.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A single feature can:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Generate high-authority backlinks that strengthen your domain</li>
            <li>• Increase brand mentions and trust signals</li>
            <li>• Drive long-term referral traffic</li>
            <li>• Support rankings for branded and non-branded keywords</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            These signals tell search engines that your business is credible and worth surfacing. Over time, that compounds quietly in the background while you focus on running the business.
          </p>

          <h3>Press Supports Sales Without Feeling Salesy</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Press doesn't push people to buy, it reassures them.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            People who discover your brand through press tend to convert better because they arrive with confidence. They've already been introduced to you by a source they trust. They're not asking, "Is this brand legit?" They're asking, "Is this right for me?"
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That subtle difference matters.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            It's why founders often notice improved conversion rates, shorter sales cycles, and fewer objections after securing press. Trust, SEO, and sales all get boosted together.

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is the part people don't love hearing, but it matters.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Most founders don't miss out on press because their product isn't good enough. They miss out because they assume press is reserved for bigger brands, when in reality it's reserved for the most interesting stories. You don't need a huge budget, you need a creative angle that makes someone want to keep reading.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            In reality, journalists feature unknown brands all the time. You only have to look at early-stage companies regularly featured on sites like TechCrunch to see that size isn't the deciding factor. For example, TechCrunch's annual round-up of the most disruptive startups regularly includes small, early-stage brands with strong stories, not just household names: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/the-51-most-disruptive-startups-of-2024/" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet">https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/the-51-most-disruptive-startups-of-2024/</a>
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            They don't feature brands that make their job harder. They feature brands that make a great story easy to tell.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If any of this feels familiar, you don't need a PR agency, you need a better system.

          <h3>Most Founders Pitch Their Brand, Not a Story</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is probably the biggest mistake I see. Founders reach out to journalists talking about their product, their launch, their mission, their features, their funding plans. All of that might be important to you, but it isn't automatically interesting to a journalist or their readers. Journalists aren't looking to promote your business. They're looking to create content their audience will actually care about. That means a timely angle, a wider trend, a problem people recognise, a clear point of view or insight, and something that fits what they're already covering. This is why you'll often see relatively small brands featured in trend-led articles, while much bigger brands get ignored. Forbes has written openly about this too, pointing out that early-stage startups can earn coverage by focusing on story and relevance, not scale: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2015/05/20/the-digs-approach-how-any-early-stage-startup-can-get-media-coverage/" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet">https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2015/05/20/the-digs-approach-how-any-early-stage-startup-can-get-media-coverage/</a>
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If your pitch starts and ends with "we've launched" or "we're doing something exciting", it usually gets ignored, not because it's bad, but because it doesn't answer the unspoken question: why should anyone else care?
          </p>

          <h3>Founders Overestimate How Much Journalists Know About Them</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This one is subtle, but important. When you live and breathe your business every day, it's easy to assume people know who you are, or at least understand the context. Journalists don't. They scan emails quickly, often between meetings or on tight deadlines, and they don't have time to piece together why your brand matters. If your pitch requires effort to understand, it's already lost. Clear beats clever every time.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">

          <h3>Most Pitches Are Sent to the Wrong People</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Another common issue is relevance. A SaaS founder pitches a lifestyle journalist. A beauty brand emails a tech reporter. An ecommerce founder sends the same pitch to everyone. It's not malicious, it's usually just rushed. Journalists are protective of their inboxes. If you repeatedly send irrelevant pitches, they stop opening your emails entirely. That why finding the right journalist matters far more than sending lots of emails. This is where founders often get stuck, because researching journalists manually takes time, and time is the one thing most founders don't have.

          <h3>Fear of "Bothering" Journalists Holds People Back</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A lot of founders are also quietly worried about being annoying. They don't want to spam. They don't want to come across as desperate. They don't want to burn bridges. So they hesitate, overthink, or never hit send all. The irony is that journalists actively look for expert input and relevant stories. Platforms like HARO (Help a Reporter Out) were created specifically to connect journalists with founders and experts who can help them: <a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet">https://www.helpareporter.com/</a>
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When you approach journalists with something genuinely useful, timely, or insightful, you're helping them, not bothering them.
          </p>

          <h3>Founders Assume Press Takes Too Long</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Another common myth is that press is slow. Yes, some features take time. But many opportunities are reactive. Journalists are often working on pieces that need expert input now. Miss that window and it's gone. This is why you see the same founders quoted repeatedly across different outlets. They’re visible, responsive, and easy to work with. Founders who win at press tend to be the ones who can move quickly, spot opportunities, and respond without friction.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-violet/10 border border-accent-violet/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">

          <h3>Organisation Is Where Most People Fall Apart</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Even founders who start strong often lose momentum. They pitch a few journalists, forget who they contacted, can't remember who replied, and end up with half-finished spreadsheets and notes scattered everywhere. Press outreach becomes messy, inconsistent, and easy to abandon when things get busy. This is usually the point where people think, "I need an agency," when what they really need is a better system. That's one of the reasons ContactJournalists.com exists. Not to replace strategy or storytelling, but to remove the chaos. When outreach is organised, simple, and manageable, founders are far more likely to stick with it long enough to see results.

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Press isn't about confidence, connections, or being loud. It's about relevance, clarity, and timing. Once you understand that, getting press stops feeling intimidating and starts feeling doable!

            The fastest ways to get press without an agency all have one thing in common. They work with how journalists already operate, not against it.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Tie Your Story to Something That's Already Happening</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists rarely wake up thinking, "I wonder what new brand I can feature today."
            They're usually working on:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• A trend piece</li>
            <li>• A reaction to industry news</li>
            <li>• A seasonal angle</li>
            <li>• A broader conversation already unfolding</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            The quickest press wins come when your business fits naturally into that story.

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Reactive press is one of the most underused opportunities for founders.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is where journalists actively ask for input, quotes, or examples, often with tight deadlines. When you respond quickly and clearly, you can land coverage without pitching at all.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You're not pitching an idea.

          <h3>3. Lead With Insight, Not Promotion</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            One of the fastest ways to get ignored is to sound like marketing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists don't want:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Sales language</li>
            <li>• Feature lists</li>
            <li>• Brand slogans</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            They want insight.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This could be:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Something you're seeing in your data</li>
            <li>• A pattern emerging in your industry</li>
            <li>• A problem customers keep mentioning</li>
            <li>• A mistake founders commonly make</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When you lead with insight, your brand becomes context, not the headline.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Be Specific, Not Broad</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Specific stories travel faster.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Compare:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Specificity makes your pitch easier to understand, easier to place, and easier to turn into a quote or feature.

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This sounds obvious, but it's huge.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Founders who get featured repeatedly tend to:

            <li>• Reply quickly</li>
            <li>• Answer questions clearly</li>
            <li>• Avoid jargon</li>
            <li>• Stick to deadlines</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists remember this.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">

            When I was building <a href="https://www.itreallyworksvitamins.com" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It Really Works Vitamins</a>, I assumed press was about writing the perfect pitch, explaining the brand properly. Making sure everything sounded impressive enough: when actually this mindset slowed everything down and I became the bottleneck in my marketing
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            What I learned very quickly is that journalists aren't browsing brands, they're building stories under pressure.
          </p>

          <h3>Journalists Aren't Looking for Brands, They're Looking for Help</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When you're deep inside your own business, it's easy to forget that journalists don't wake up thinking, "Which startup should I feature today?" They're usually thinking, "I need a quote, an example, or insight for something I'm already writing."
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Once that clicked for me everything changed.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Instead of trying to introduce my brand from scratch every time, I focused on being useful. Offering perspective. Answering a question. Adding context to a wider conversation that was already happening.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That's when things started to click.
          </p>

          <h3>Speed Beats Polish Every Time</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This was another big lesson.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            As a founder, especially when it's your business, it's tempting to overthink everything. You want to say it perfectly. You want to explain the nuance. You want to get it just right.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists don't need perfect. They need clear, relevant, and on time.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Some of the coverage I was most proud of didn't come from beautifully crafted pitches. It came from responding quickly with something genuinely helpful while a journalist was in the middle of writing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you arrive after the deadline, even the best story won't get used.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Being There In the Moment Matters So Much</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is where live press opportunities make such a difference.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When a journalist is actively requesting input, they're already writing the piece. They're not evaluating whether your brand is "big enough". They're looking for someone who can help them finish their article.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you're there at that moment, responding clearly and quickly, you've effectively skipped the hardest part of press. You're not competing with hundreds of cold pitches. You're contributing to a story that already exists.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That dynamic is completely different, and it's one I wish I'd understood earlier.
          </p>

          <h3>Journalists Remember Founders Who Make Their Lives Easier</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Another thing I noticed as my business grew is that journalists remember people who are easy to work with.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you reply quickly.
            If you stay on topic.
            If you give quotes they can actually use.
            You don't just get featured once. You often get pulled into future pieces without pitching again.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That's how momentum builds. Quietly, over time.
          </p>

          <h3>Some founders seem to be "everywhere" in the press. It's rarely luck. It's because they've learned how to work in a way that fits journalists' reality.</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This Isn't About Confidence or Being Loud
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            I wasn't particularly confident when I started pitching press. I didn't have industry connections. I wasn't trying to be loud or attention-seeking.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            What I did have was a growing understanding of how journalists actually work, and that made press feel far more doable.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Once you stop seeing journalists as gatekeepers and start seeing them as people doing a job under pressure, press becomes less intimidating and much more practical.
          </p>

            className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6"
          />

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When I was building <a href="https://www.itreallyworksvitamins.com" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It Really Works Vitamins</a>, one of the biggest time-wasters early on was not knowing who I should actually be talking to. I knew press mattered. I knew I had a story. What I didn't have was clarity on which journalists were relevant and which ones I was simply wasting time on.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is where a lot of founders quietly get stuck.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            They either pitch everyone and hear nothing back, or they spend hours Googling, clicking through old articles, opening endless tabs, and still aren't confident they've found the right person. When you're running a business, that kind of effort just isn't sustainable.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Here's the shift that made the biggest difference for me.
          </p>

          <h3>Stop Thinking in Terms of Publications, Start Thinking in Terms of Journalists</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            It's easy to say, "I want to be in Forbes" or "I want to be in TechCrunch". That normal. But publications don't write articles, journalists do.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Inside every publication are dozens of writers, each with:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• A specific beat</li>
            <li>• A specific interest area</li>
            <li>• A specific type of story they cover again and again</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Once you start focusing on who is writing the articles you already like and recognise, everything becomes clearer.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If someone has written three pieces on founder burnout, ecommerce trends, or beauty ingredient transparency, that's not a coincidence. That's their lane.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Those are the people you want to be speaking to.
          </p>

          <h3>Match Your Business to the Journalist's World</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            One of the simplest questions to ask yourself is this:
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If I were a journalist, where would my business naturally fit into a story?
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            For example:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• A SaaS founder might be relevant to stories about remote work, productivity, AI, or scaling teams</li>
            <li>• A beauty founder might fit into conversations around skincare trends, ingredient education, sustainability, or consumer trust</li>
            <li>• An ecommerce founder might be relevant to discussions about logistics, returns, customer behaviour, or online shopping habits</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You're not looking for someone who might be interested. You're looking for someone who is already writing about this.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That's the difference between a pitch that gets ignored and one that gets read.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Manual Research Breaks Down for Most Founders</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            In theory, you can find journalists manually.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You can:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Search articles</li>
            <li>• Click author bios</li>
            <li>• Look them up on social platforms</li>
            <li>• Try to find contact details</li>
            <li>• Keep notes somewhere</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            In practice, this is where things fall apart.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            It's time-consuming, easy to lose track of, and hard to keep up to date. Journalists move publications, change beats, and shift focus all the time. What was accurate six months ago might not be accurate now.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is usually the point where founders think, "I just don't have time for this," and press quietly slips down the priority list.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This Is Where Having a Proper Tool Changes Everything
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Having one place where you can:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Search journalists by industry, topic, and publication</li>
            <li>• See what they're actively writing about</li>
            <li>• Keep track of who you've contacted</li>
            <li>• Know who has replied and who hasn't</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            …turns press from something vague into something manageable.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That's exactly what ContactJournalists.com is designed to do. Instead of guessing or relying on messy spreadsheets, you can approach outreach with intention and clarity, even if you only have a small amount of time each week.
          </p>

          <h3>Quality Beats Quantity Every Time</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is important.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You don't need to contact hundreds of journalists.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Five well-chosen, genuinely relevant contacts will always outperform fifty random emails. Journalists can tell when you've done your homework, and they respond differently when they feel like you're speaking directly to them, not blasting a list.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Press works best when it feels considered, not desperate.
          </p>

          <h3>Start Small and Build Momentum</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you're new to press, you don't need to do everything at once.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Start by:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Identifying a small handful of journalists who genuinely fit your business</li>
            <li>• Reading their recent articles</li>
            <li>• Noting the angles they care about</li>
            <li>• Thinking about where your experience or story could add value</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Once you land one piece of coverage, everything gets easier. Confidence improves, outreach feels less intimidating, and journalists are more likely to take you seriously next time.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Momentum matters more than perfection.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is the bit most founders overthink.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When I was building <a href="https://www.itreallyworksvitamins.com" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It Really Works Vitamins</a>, I used to sit staring at a draft pitch, tweaking words, worrying about tone, wondering if it sounded "professional enough". I thought pitching press meant crafting something impressive.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            What I eventually learned is that journalists don't want impressive.
            They want useful, relevant, and easy.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Once I stopped writing pitches like marketing emails and started writing them like a human responding to another human, reply rates changed almost immediately.
          </p>

          <h3>The Biggest Mindset Shift: You're Not Pitching, You're Helping</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            The best way to think about a press pitch is this:
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You're not asking for coverage.
            You're offering help.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A journalist already has a story in mind. Your job is to make that story better, easier to write, or more credible.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That's it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If your pitch answers a question they're already working through, it doesn't feel like a pitch at all.
          </p>

          <h3>Keep It Short (Shorter Than You Think)</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is where most people go wrong.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists skim. Fast.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If your pitch is more than a few short paragraphs, chances are they won't read it properly. That doesn't mean your idea isn't good, it just means they don't have time.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A strong pitch usually includes:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Who you are (one line)</li>
            <li>• Why this is relevant right now</li>
            <li>• What you can offer (insight, quote, data, example)</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That's it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            No brand history.
            No life story.
            No feature list.
            You can always give more later if they're interested.
          </p>

          <h3>Lead With the Angle, Not the Brand</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Founders naturally want to explain what they do first. Journalists don't care yet.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Instead of leading with:
            "We're a startup that does X…"
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Lead with:
            "I saw you're writing about Y, and I can add Z based on what I'm seeing firsthand."
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That instantly tells the journalist:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• You've read their work</li>
            <li>• You understand what they're covering</li>
            <li>• You're relevant to this specific story</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Your brand becomes context, not the headline.
          </p>

          <h3>Make It Easy to Say Yes</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            One thing I didn't appreciate early on is how much journalists value ease.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Offer a short, usable quote</li>
            <li>• Are available quickly</li>
            <li>• Can answer follow-up questions</li>
            <li>• Don't push for control or approval</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You're far more likely to be included.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists don't want friction. They want things they can drop straight into an article.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you can give them something they can almost copy and paste, you're doing it right.
          </p>

          <h3>Don't Be Afraid of Follow-Ups (But Be Human)</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Another common fear is follow-ups.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A single, polite follow-up a few days later is completely fine. Journalists miss emails all the time. Following up isn't rude, it's practical.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            What doesn't work is:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Chasing daily</li>
            <li>• Adding pressure</li>
            <li>• Sounding entitled</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A simple "just wanted to check this didn't get buried" is enough.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Live Opportunities Make Pitching Easier</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            One of the reasons pitching feels so hard for founders is that they're pitching blind. They don't know if a journalist is even interested in that topic right now.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When a journalist is actively requesting sources, the dynamic changes completely. You're no longer guessing what to say, you're responding directly to what they've asked for.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That why pitches tied to live requests tend to feel easier to write and get better response rates. You answering a question, not selling an idea.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-violet/10 border border-accent-violet/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
              👉 If you want pitching to feel simpler and more natural, having visibility over what journalists are actually looking for right now makes a huge difference.

          <h3>One Final Thing Most Founders Miss</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Silence doesn't always mean rejection.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Sometimes it means:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• The article ran without quotes</li>
            <li>• The angle changed</li>
            <li>• The journalist ran out of space</li>
            <li>• They bookmarked you for later</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Press is rarely linear.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Consistency beats intensity. A handful of thoughtful pitches over time will outperform a burst of rushed outreach every single time.

            className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6"
          />

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is the side of press most founders don't realise exists until someone points it out.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Not all press comes from pitching ideas and hoping they land. A huge amount of coverage comes from reacting quickly to things journalists are already working on. This is often called reactive PR, and it's one of the fastest ways to get featured without an agency.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When I first came across this while building <a href="https://www.itreallyworksvitamins.com" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It Really Works Vitamins</a>, it genuinely felt like a cheat code.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Instead of trying to convince someone to write about my brand, I was stepping into conversations that were already happening.
          </p>

          <h3>What Reactive PR Actually Is</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Reactive PR is simple in principle.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A journalist is writing an article and needs:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Expert input</li>
            <li>• A quote</li>
            <li>• A real-world example</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            So they put out a request asking for help.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you respond quickly and clearly, you can be included in the piece, sometimes within hours.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You're not pitching an idea.
            You're answering a question.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That why this works so well.
          </p>

          <h3>HARO: The Classic Example</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            HARO (Help a Reporter Out) is one of the most well-known reactive PR platforms, and it's a good example of how this side of press works. Journalists submit requests looking for expert insight, and founders respond with relevant commentary.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
              👉 <a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold">https://www.helpareporter.com/</a>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            The upside:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Journalists are actively looking for sources</li>
            <li>• You know exactly what they need</li>
            <li>• There's no guesswork on angles</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            The downside:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Requests can be overwhelming</li>
            <li>• Responses need to be fast</li>
            <li>• Without organisation, it becomes chaotic very quickly</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is where a lot of founders fall off. They see opportunities, but by the time they've drafted a response, the journalist has already moved on.
          </p>

          <h3>Twitter/X: Journalists Asking in Public</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A surprising number of journalists now use Twitter/X to ask for sources in real time.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You'll regularly see posts like:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• "Looking for founders who've experienced X"</li>
            <li>• "Need an expert quote on Y"</li>
            <li>• "Anyone running a business in Z space?"</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            These posts move fast, and replies stack up quickly. Journalists often choose from the first few useful responses they receive.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you're there early and you add value, you can land coverage without sending a single pitch email.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-violet/10 border border-accent-violet/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
              👉 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=looking%20for%20founders&src=typed_query" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold">https://twitter.com/search?q=looking%20for%20founders&src=typed_query</a>
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Newsjacking: When Timing Is Everything</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Newsjacking is about reacting to wider news, trends, or cultural moments and offering a relevant perspective while the conversation is still forming.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This could include:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Industry regulation changes</li>
            <li>• Consumer behaviour shifts</li>
            <li>• New research or data releases</li>
            <li>• Viral conversations or breaking news</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you can offer a grounded, relevant take while journalists are shaping their articles, you can be pulled into coverage very quickly. This kind of reactive commentary is often what leads to quotes in articles across tech, business, and lifestyle publications.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Speed Changes the Entire Dynamic</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is the most important part.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            When you pitch cold, you're competing with hundreds of emails sitting in an inbox. When you respond to a live request, you're often competing with far fewer people, and the journalist is actively looking for help right now.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you're early and useful, you've effectively skipped the hardest part of press. You're not competing with hundreds of cold pitches. You're contributing to a story that already exists.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That dynamic is completely different, and it's one I wish I'd understood earlier.
          </p>

          <h3>Making Reactive PR Work Without Taking Over Your Life</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            The challenge with reactive PR is volume and timing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Opportunities can appear at any time. Some will be relevant, many won't. Without a system, it's easy to miss the good ones or burn out trying to monitor everything manually.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is where having one place to:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• See live journalist requests</li>
            <li>• Filter by relevance</li>
            <li>• Respond quickly</li>
            <li>• Track what you've replied to</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            …makes a huge difference.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">

          <h3>A Final Reality Check</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You won't land coverage from every request you respond to. That's normal.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            But one good reactive feature can lead to:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Follow-up requests</li>
            <li>• Ongoing journalist relationships</li>
            <li>• Faster credibility building</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            And once you've been featured once, the next opportunity often comes much easier.

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            One of the biggest mistakes founders make is assuming the same pitch works everywhere.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            It doesn't.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            What gets a SaaS founder featured won't work for a beauty brand. What works for ecommerce won't land in tech press. I learned this first-hand while building <a href="https://www.itreallyworksvitamins.com" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It Really Works Vitamins</a>. The business stayed the same, but the angles that worked changed depending on who I was pitching and what they cared about.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Once you understand this, press stops feeling random.
          </p>

          <h3>Beauty & Wellness: Why Some Brands Get Covered Everywhere</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A great real-world example of this is Ami Colé.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Ami Colé didn't get press because they launched another makeup line. They got press because they were part of a much bigger conversation around inclusivity and representation in beauty. That angle landed them coverage across major publications because editors were already writing about the lack of products designed for melanin-rich skin tones.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-violet/10 border border-accent-violet/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
              👉 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ami_Col%C3%A9" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ami_Colé</a>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            The pitch wasn't "here's our product."
            The pitch was "this is a shift happening in the industry, and here's why it matters."
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That why it worked.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Another strong example is Saie, a clean beauty brand that earned coverage by positioning itself within conversations around sustainability, climate responsibility, and transparency, rather than focusing purely on launches.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">

            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Again, the story wasn't about how good the product was. It was about how consumer values were changing, and how beauty brands were responding to that shift.
          </p>

          <h3>What This Means for Beauty Founders</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you're building a beauty or wellness brand, journalists are far more interested in:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• What consumers are confused about</li>
            <li>• What misinformation you see regularly</li>
            <li>• How buying behaviour is changing</li>
            <li>• Why certain trends are happening now</li>
            <li>• What people are getting wrong</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            They want clarity and context, not promotion.
          </p>

          <h3>SaaS: Pitches That Work Because They Lead With Insight</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            SaaS press works best when founders stop talking about features and start talking about what they're seeing before everyone else notices it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists covering SaaS and tech care about:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• How people are actually working now</li>
            <li>• What's breaking behind the scenes</li>
            <li>• Where tools are creating friction instead of solving problems</li>
            <li>• Patterns founders are seeing across users or teams</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A good real-world example of this is how founders regularly appear in TechCrunch commenting on broader shifts, not just their own product.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            For example, TechCrunch frequently features early-stage founders sharing insight on remote work, AI adoption, or startup mistakes, even when the company itself isn't the headline:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-violet/10 border border-accent-violet/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
              👉 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/startups/" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold">https://techcrunch.com/tag/startups/</a>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Another strong example is founder commentary featured in Forbes, where SaaS founders are quoted discussing leadership, scaling, or operational challenges rather than pitching tools:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
              👉 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/startups/" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold">https://www.forbes.com/startups/</a>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            In both cases, the angle isn't "look at my software."
            It's "here's what I'm seeing from the front line."
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            That why it works.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If you're a SaaS founder, the most effective pitches usually sound like:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• "We're seeing teams struggle with X now that Y has changed"</li>
            <li>• "Here's a mistake we keep seeing founders make at scale"</li>
            <li>• "This trend looks positive on paper, but here's the downside no one talks about"</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Your product becomes context, not the story.
          </p>

          <h3>Ecommerce: Real Experience Beats Polished Stories Every Time</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Ecommerce press is one of the most forgiving categories if you're honest.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists covering ecommerce love real-world experience because it's relatable and useful. They're interested in:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Returns and logistics</li>
            <li>• Margins and delivery expectations</li>
            <li>• How Amazon has changed customer behaviour</li>
            <li>• What scaling actually looks like</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A great real-world example of ecommerce founders being featured for experience, not products, can be seen in coverage across Business Insider, where founders regularly talk about the realities of running online businesses:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-violet/10 border border-accent-violet/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
              👉 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ecommerce" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold">https://www.businessinsider.com/ecommerce</a>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Another example is ecommerce founders being quoted in The Guardian discussing rising costs, delivery pressures, and consumer behaviour, rather than promoting stores:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-slate-200 mb-4">
              👉 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/ecommerce" className="text-accent-blue hover:text-accent-violet font-semibold">https://www.theguardian.com/business/ecommerce</a>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            These stories work because they reflect what readers are already experiencing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            The best ecommerce pitches usually revolve around:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• "This surprised me when we scaled"</li>
            <li>• "Customers expect this now, whether it's realistic or not"</li>
            <li>• "Here's what’s actually hurting margins right now"</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            You don't need to sound successful. You need to sound real.
          </p>

          <h3>The One Rule That Applies to Every Industry</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            No matter what you sell, one rule always applies:
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists care about readers, not brands.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If your pitch:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>• Helps someone understand something</li>
            <li>• Reflects what people are already experiencing</li>
            <li>• Adds context to a wider conversation</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            …it has a genuine chance of being used.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Once you stop asking, "How do I promote my business?" and start asking, "Where does my experience add value?", press becomes much easier.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">

        <section id="common-mistakes" className="mb-16">
          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Common PR Mistakes That Quietly Kill Your Chances</h2>

          <img
            src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559136555-9303baea8ebd?w=600&h=300&fit=crop"
            alt="Avoiding mistakes in PR outreach"
            className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6"
          />

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Most founders don't realise they're making PR mistakes because they're not doing anything wrong on purpose. They're just approaching press from a founder mindset instead of a journalist one.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            These are the most common things I see that quietly stop good founders from getting coverage.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Leading With the Brand Instead of the Angle</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This is the big one.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Opening with who you are, what you do, and why your product is great feels logical as a founder. For journalists, it's usually the least interesting part.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            If the first thing they read is your brand name and product description, there's a good chance they won't read the rest.
          </p>

          <h4>Fix:</h4>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Lead with the idea, the insight, or the problem. Let your brand appear naturally as context.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Pitching Too Broadly</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Pitches like "we help businesses grow" or "our product solves many problems" don't give journalists anything to work with.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Vague stories are hard to place.
          </p>

          <h4>Fix:</h4>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Be specific. One clear insight, one clear angle, one clear reason it matters now.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Chasing Logos Instead of Relevance</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Wanting to be featured in big publications is normal. Chasing them without relevance is where things fall apart.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            A perfect story in the wrong publication still won't run.
          </p>

          <h4>Fix:</h4>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Focus on journalists already writing about your topic, not just the publication name at the top of the page.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Sounding Like Marketing Copy</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Journalists can spot marketing language instantly.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Phrases like "disrupting the industry," "game-changing," or "innovative solution" usually switch people off.
          </p>

          <h4>Fix:</h4>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Write like a human explaining something clearly. If it sounds like a landing page, rewrite it.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Overthinking and Missing the Moment</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            This one hurts because it's so common.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Founders spend too long polishing pitches and miss deadlines, especially with reactive press opportunities.
          </p>

          <h4>Fix:</h4>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Prioritise clarity and speed over perfection. A helpful response on time beats a perfect one too late.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Giving Up Too Quickly</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Press rarely works on the first attempt.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Silence doesn't always mean no. It often means "not right now".
          </p>

          <h4>Fix:</h4>

          <p className="text-slate-300 mb-6">
            Be consistent, not intense. A handful of thoughtful pitches over time beats a burst of rushed outreach.
          </p>
