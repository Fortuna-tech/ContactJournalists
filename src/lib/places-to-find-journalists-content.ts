    <strong>TL;DR (for exhausted founders who just want the truth)</strong>
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Most founders don't struggle with PR because their story is bad.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    They struggle because they're guessing.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Guessing:</strong>
  </p>

  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Where journalists actually hang out</li>
    <li>Which platforms are worth the effort</li>
    <li>Whether silence means "not relevant" or "wrong place"</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Journalists don't live in one neat database. They move between platforms depending on beat, deadline pressure, format, and how they prefer to work. Some places are great for research. Some are good for live opportunities. Some look useful but quietly drain weeks.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>This guide breaks down:</strong>

  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>20 real places journalists actually use</li>
    <li>What each one is best for (and what it isn't)</li>

    <li>How founders actually use these platforms in real life</li>
    <li>Why having one system matters more than being everywhere</li>

    If you're trying to find journalists covering your niche and get press without a PR agency, this will save you serious time.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Hi, I'm Fortuna 👋</h2>

  <img src="/assets/stock_images/fortuna-founder.png" alt="Fortuna Burke, founder of ContactJournalists.com" class="float-left mr-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-48 md:w-56" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Before building ContactJournalists.com, I ran a consumer brand where press coverage genuinely mattered.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What surprised me wasn't writing pitches. It was how fragmented journalist discovery is.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Some journalists lived on Twitter. Some only appeared in Google News bylines. Some ran newsletters. Some only surfaced when they actively asked for sources.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Every blog said "find the right journalist". None explained where founders are actually supposed to look, or what each option really costs in time, energy, and attention.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    So I tested everything. The good. The bad. The quietly exhausting.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This article is the shortcut I wish I'd had.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">1. ContactJournalists.com</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    ContactJournalists.com exists because journalists don't live in one place, and founders don't have time to chase them across ten tabs.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Instead of jumping between platforms, you can:
  </p>

  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Find journalists by niche</li>
    <li>See bloggers, newsletter writers, and podcasters</li>
    <li>Respond to live journalist requests</li>
    <li>Reach out directly, all in one place</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The biggest difference here is certainty. You're not guessing whether a journalist might be relevant or whether now is a good time. You can see who covers your space and who is actively open to sources.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Centralised journalist discovery</li>
    <li>Receive live requests from journalists / podcasters</li>
    <li>Reply instantly with our AI Responder</li>
    <li>Built for founders, not agencies</li>
    <li>7 day free trial: <a href="/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">start now at contactjournalists.com</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Not designed for mass blasting</li>
    <li>Works best when used consistently</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Overall:</strong> ContactJournalists.com is a purpose-built platform designed to help founders find journalists covering their niche without relying on fragmented tools. Instead of searching across Twitter, Google News, media lists, and inbox alerts, everything lives in one place. Founders can discover journalists, bloggers, newsletter writers, and podcasters by niche, while also seeing live journalist requests from people actively looking for sources. This approach removes much of the guesswork from PR and makes journalist discovery feel structured rather than chaotic, which is especially important for founders trying to get press coverage without hiring a PR agency.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">2. X (Twitter)</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <img src="/assets/stock_images/coffee-desk.png" alt="Coffee mug on minimal desk setup" class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-48 md:w-56" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Twitter is still one of the most honest windows into a journalist's world. Journalists post source requests, talk about what they're researching, and vent about bad pitches in real time.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The challenge is that everything moves fast. Tweets disappear quickly, timelines are noisy, and unless you're watching constantly, you'll miss opportunities.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Real-time journalist signals</li>
    <li>Unfiltered insight into interests and tone</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Extremely noisy</li>
    <li>Easy to miss requests</li>
    <li>No structure</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Overall:</strong> X (Twitter.com) remains one of the most active places journalists publicly signal what they're working on. Many reporters use the platform to ask for sources, share early story ideas, or highlight the types of pitches they're interested in receiving. For founders, X is less about broadcasting and more about observation. It offers real-time visibility into journalist interests, language, and timing, which can be useful when trying to understand how and when to approach media contacts in your niche.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Great for listening and spotting opportunities, terrible as your only system. Noisy, full of distractions and potentially very stressful.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">3. Google News</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Google News is one of the most reliable ways to see who actually covers your niche. Searching your industry and clicking bylines reveals patterns that tools often miss.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Over time, you can spot journalists who consistently return to the same themes and publications that regularly feature stories like yours.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Very accurate</li>
    <li>Shows real coverage history</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Entirely manual</li>
    <li>Slow</li>
    <li>No alerts</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Excellent for research, painful for speed.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Overall:</strong> Google News is one of the most effective tools for identifying journalists who consistently cover a specific topic or industry. By searching your niche and reviewing bylines, you can see who is actively writing about subjects related to your business, how often they publish, and which publications they contribute to. While it requires manual effort, Google News provides high-quality insight into real editorial patterns, making it a valuable research tool when building a targeted list of journalists.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">4. HARO</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲–💲💲 (Free–£149/month)</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    HARO flips the power dynamic. Instead of pitching cold, you're replying to journalists who are actively asking for sources.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This makes it a great learning tool for founders, but it can quickly become overwhelming due to inbox volume and competition.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Journalists explicitly asking for help</li>
    <li>Clear requests</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Inbox overload</li>
    <li>Heavy competition</li>
    <li>Many broad requests</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Overall:</strong> HARO connects journalists with sources by sending out regular emails containing media requests. Journalists use HARO when they need expert quotes, case studies, or commentary on short deadlines. For founders, it offers a direct way to respond to journalist needs rather than pitching cold. The platform is competitive and inbox-heavy, but it remains a popular option for founders looking to gain press coverage through direct journalist requests.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Helpful, but mentally draining if relied on alone.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">5. Qwoted</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲💲 (£99–£249/month)</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Qwoted works best when your authority is clear. Journalists here are often looking for expert commentary rather than product stories.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If you're a founder with strong expertise in B2B, tech, finance, or leadership, this can work well. For consumer brands, it's more hit-and-miss.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Credibility-driven</li>
    <li>Journalist-led requests</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Weak for ecommerce</li>
    <li>Expertise matters more than story</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Overall:</strong> Qwoted is a journalist sourcing platform that focuses heavily on expert commentary and thought leadership. Journalists use it to find credible sources for stories in areas like business, technology, finance, and leadership. Founders with clear expertise or strong professional backgrounds often find Qwoted useful, particularly for B2B press coverage. The platform prioritises authority and relevance, which means responses need to be concise, well-positioned, and genuinely insightful.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Strong for experts, less forgiving for product-led brands.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">6. Substack</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲–💲💲 (Free–£50)</strong></p>

  <img src="/assets/stock_images/laptop-coffee-cozy.png" alt="Cozy laptop and coffee setup" class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-48 md:w-56" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Many journalists now write independently on Substack, which changes how pitching works. You're often engaging with a person, not an institution.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Substack is powerful because it shows what journalists care about enough to write without an editor. That context makes outreach more human.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Direct access</li>
    <li>High trust audiences</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Smaller reach</li>
    <li>Requires genuine alignment</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Overall:</strong> Substack has become an increasingly important place where journalists publish independently. Many reporters use Substack to explore topics more deeply, build direct relationships with readers, and test ideas outside traditional newsrooms. For founders, Substack offers insight into what journalists care about enough to write on their own terms. Engaging with journalists through Substack can feel more personal and less transactional, especially for opinion-led or industry-specific stories.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Great for thoughtful, opinion-led stories. Time consuming though!
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">7. LinkedIn</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲–💲💲 (Free–£79/month)</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    LinkedIn is not a pitching channel, but it's excellent for journalist research. Journalists use it to describe their beats, share work, and signal changes.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Understanding a journalist's background here can dramatically improve outreach elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Context-rich</li>
    <li>Shows beat changes</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Cold DMs rarely work</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Overall:</strong> LinkedIn is widely used by journalists as a professional profile and distribution channel. Reporters often share published articles, describe their beats, and signal shifts in focus through their LinkedIn profiles. While it's not typically effective for cold pitching, LinkedIn is extremely useful for research. Founders can use it to understand a journalist's background, current role, and areas of interest before reaching out elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Use it to understand, not to pitch.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">8. Podcasts</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Podcasts reveal curiosity. You hear what journalists ask, where they feel stories are missing nuance, and what genuinely excites them.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Podcast outreach is slower, but it often leads to deeper relationships and follow-on coverage.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Trust-building</li>
    <li>Long-term value</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Slower payoff</li>
    <li>Time-intensive</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Many journalists host podcasts or appear regularly as guests. Podcasts offer a different window into how journalists think, what questions they ask, and which topics they find most compelling. For founders, podcasts can be a valuable route to building relationships and gaining credibility over time. Podcast appearances often lead to further media opportunities, particularly in niche industries where trust and familiarity matter.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Patience required, but high relationship value.
  </p>

  <div class="bg-accent-mint/10 border border-accent-mint/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
    <p class="text-white font-semibold mb-3">If you're serious about getting press coverage without a PR agency...</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">ContactJournalists.com offers a 7-day free trial, so you can explore the platform, see how journalist discovery works in practice, and decide whether this approach fits how you want to grow.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300">That's how founders find journalists covering their niche without burning out — with clarity, relevance, and a system that does the heavy lifting.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">9. Industry Publications</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Industry publications may have smaller audiences, but they offer deep relevance. Journalists here understand the space and value nuance.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Highly targeted audiences</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Slower editorial cycles</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Overall:</strong> Industry publications focus on specific sectors such as technology, wellness, finance, retail, or manufacturing. Journalists working for these outlets often have deep subject knowledge and write repeatedly about the same themes. Founders targeting industry publications benefit from highly relevant audiences and more nuanced coverage, though editorial timelines can be slower than mainstream media.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Quality beats speed.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">10. Journalist Newsletters</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Journalist newsletters have become an important part of how many reporters think and write. Unlike published articles, newsletters are often less polished and more exploratory, which makes them a valuable signal for founders trying to understand what a journalist is genuinely interested in. Journalists use newsletters to test ideas, comment on industry shifts, and share early observations that may later turn into full articles.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For founders, following journalist newsletters provides context that's hard to get elsewhere. You can see how a journalist frames topics, which angles they return to, and what questions they're actively thinking about. This makes pitching far more natural, as you're responding to an existing train of thought rather than introducing something out of the blue.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Early insight into topics before they become published articles</li>
    <li>More personal tone than traditional media coverage</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Smaller audiences compared to mainstream publications</li>
    <li>Not every newsletter leads directly to published stories</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Journalist newsletters are less about reach and more about relevance. When used well, they help founders pitch with context instead of guesswork.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">11. Facebook Journalist Groups</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Despite everything else changing in media, Facebook journalist groups remain surprisingly active in certain niches, particularly lifestyle, parenting, local news, freelancing, and community-focused publications. These groups function as semi-private spaces where journalists feel comfortable asking for sources, sharing callouts, and requesting examples without broadcasting to the entire internet.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What makes these groups different from public platforms is trust. Journalists often post in Facebook groups because they expect a higher signal-to-noise ratio. That means fewer generic replies and more relevant, thoughtful responses from people who understand the niche. For founders, this can create genuine opportunities, but only if the space is treated as a community rather than a pitching channel.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    These groups tend to have clear rules, active moderation, and very low tolerance for self-promotion. Founders who succeed here usually spend time observing first, responding only when there's a genuine fit, and keeping replies concise and helpful rather than sales-led.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Direct access to journalist source requests</li>
    <li>Niche-specific opportunities, especially in lifestyle and local media</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Zero tolerance for spam or promotional language</li>
    <li>Opportunities can disappear quickly once filled</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> These groups can be quietly effective, but only for founders who respect the community and lead with usefulness, not promotion.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">12. Reddit</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Reddit isn't a place to pitch journalists directly, but it is one of the places journalists quietly pay attention to. Many reporters use Reddit to observe how people actually talk about problems, products, and trends in the real world, without the polish you see in press releases or brand messaging. Subreddits often surface frustrations, patterns, and emerging conversations long before they appear in mainstream coverage.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For founders, Reddit is valuable because it helps you understand how a story might be framed, not who to send it to. Reading threads in relevant subreddits can reveal the language people use, the angles that resonate emotionally, and the gaps journalists may later explore in articles. That insight can significantly improve how you position a story when you do reach out elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The limitation is clear: Reddit isn't an outreach channel. Journalists are observing, not inviting pitches. Any attempt to promote directly usually backfires. Its role is upstream, shaping how you think about a story before you ever contact a journalist.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Excellent early signal for emerging trends and narratives</li>
    <li>Unfiltered insight into real-world pain points and language</li>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">13. Editorial Calendars</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Editorial calendars outline the planned themes, features, and coverage windows that publications intend to run over the coming months. They're most common for magazines, trade publications, and long-lead outlets where content is commissioned well in advance. Editors and journalists use these calendars to map upcoming issues, seasonal angles, and recurring topics before deadlines start to bite.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For founders, editorial calendars are useful because they introduce intentional timing into PR. Instead of pitching reactively, you can align your story with topics a publication already plans to cover, such as seasonal trends, annual reports, buying guides, or industry forecasts. This increases relevance and reduces the feeling that you're interrupting a journalist's workflow.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The limitation is immediacy. Editorial calendars don't help with breaking news or short-notice opportunities, and they require forward planning. They work best for product launches, trend commentary, and evergreen stories that benefit from being placed months ahead rather than rushed into coverage.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Clear visibility into planned editorial themes</li>
    <li>Useful for seasonal, long-lead, and trend-based pitching</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>No support for real-time or reactive opportunities</li>
    <li>Requires advance planning and patience</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Editorial calendars are helpful when you're thinking ahead, but limited if you're looking for fast wins or immediate press coverage.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">14. Slack Communities</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲–💲💲 (Free–£50)</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Private Slack communities exist across many industries and often include journalists, writers, editors, and experienced operators who already know the space well. These communities are usually invitation-only and centred around peer discussion, knowledge-sharing, and industry problem-solving rather than pitching or promotion. That alone makes them very different from public platforms.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When journalists are present in Slack communities, they're typically there to listen, ask informal questions, or sense-check ideas rather than to announce source requests publicly. For founders, this creates a high-trust environment where relationships can form more naturally over time. Media opportunities often emerge indirectly, through conversations, shared context, or referrals, rather than explicit "looking for sources" posts.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The challenge is access and scale. Slack communities are difficult to find, slow to join, and not designed for systematic outreach. They work best when you're already active in the industry and contributing meaningfully, not when you're trying to extract quick wins.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>High-trust, niche-specific environments</li>
    <li>Informal access to journalists and editors</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Difficult to discover and gain access</li>
    <li>Not scalable or predictable</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Gold when available, but best treated as a bonus channel rather than a core PR strategy.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">15. Manual Media Lists</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲💲 (£50–£300)</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Manual media lists are collections of journalist names, email addresses, and sometimes beats, usually sold as a quick way to "get started" with PR. On the surface, they feel efficient. You get a spreadsheet, a sense of progress, and the illusion that outreach is now just a matter of sending emails.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The problem is decay. Journalists change beats, switch publications, update contact preferences, or stop covering certain topics far more frequently than most lists are updated. Without context around what a journalist is actively writing about right now, media lists encourage broad, generic pitching that looks productive but rarely converts into replies or coverage.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For founders, the biggest cost isn't the money, it's the time spent chasing outdated contacts and wondering why nothing lands. Media lists work best as a very rough starting point for research, not as a standalone outreach strategy.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Fast to acquire</li>
    <li>Can provide an initial sense of the media landscape</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Quickly outdated</li>
    <li>Lacks editorial context and intent</li>
    <li>Encourages generic, low-relevance pitching</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Manual media lists feel efficient, but they often create more work than they save.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">16. Press Request Newsletters</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲–💲💲 (£0–£100)</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Press request newsletters are email-based digests that circulate journalist queries within a specific industry or professional community. They're often run by trade bodies, media networks, industry platforms, or independent curators who collect journalist requests and redistribute them to a targeted audience.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What makes these newsletters useful is focus. Because they tend to serve a single niche, the requests are often more relevant than what you'll see on large, generalist platforms. For founders operating in specialised industries, this can mean fewer opportunities overall, but a much higher chance that the opportunity is actually a fit.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That said, quality varies significantly. Some newsletters are well-curated and attract serious journalist queries. Others simply recycle requests from bigger platforms or send out low-quality, poorly defined asks. Because of this, press request newsletters work best as a supplementary channel, not something you rely on day to day.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Highly niche-specific journalist requests</li>
    <li>Less competition than large, generalist platforms</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Inconsistent curation and quality</li>
    <li>Lower volume of opportunities</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> When they're good, they're very good. When they're not, they're easy to ignore.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">17. Journalist Author Pages</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Journalist author pages collect a reporter's published work in one place, usually across months or years. For founders, they're one of the most reliable ways to understand what a journalist actually covers in practice, not just what their bio says. Reading through several recent articles quickly reveals recurring themes, preferred angles, tone, and the types of stories a journalist consistently returns to.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What makes author pages particularly valuable is what they exclude. You can often see just as clearly what a journalist does not write about, which helps founders avoid wasting time pitching stories that were never going to be a fit. While this method requires patience, it provides a level of context that automated tools and media lists simply can't replicate.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Deep editorial context based on real writing history</li>
    <li>Helps identify recurring angles and long-term interests</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Entirely manual and time-consuming</li>
    <li>Difficult to use at scale across many journalists</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Insightful and grounding, but best used selectively rather than as your main discovery method.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">18. Media Databases</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲💲💲 (£200–£500+/month)</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Media databases like Cision, Muck Rack, and Roxhill are enterprise-grade tools designed primarily for PR agencies and large marketing teams. They offer searchable journalist profiles, contact information, beat histories, and often integrate with outreach and tracking tools.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For founders, the main consideration is cost. These platforms are expensive, often requiring annual contracts and offering features that solo operators don't need. If you're running a small business or early-stage startup, the ROI rarely justifies the spend unless you're doing high-volume outreach across many verticals.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Comprehensive journalist data</li>
    <li>Built-in outreach tools</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Very expensive for individual founders</li>
    <li>Overkill for most small businesses</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> Unless you have agency-level budget, these tools are probably not where you should start.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">19. Live Journalist Requests</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cost: 💲 Free (varies by platform)</strong></p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Live journalist requests are moments where a journalist explicitly says, "I'm working on this story and I need sources." These requests appear across different platforms and formats, but what makes them powerful is that intent is already established. The journalist isn't being pitched cold. They're actively looking for input, examples, or expert commentary to complete a piece they're already writing.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This completely changes the PR dynamic. Relevance is no longer theoretical, it's pre-qualified. Timing is no longer a guessing game, it's explicit. Your job as a founder isn't to convince someone you're interesting, it's to be useful quickly and clearly. That's why response rates here are consistently higher than traditional cold outreach.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For founders, live journalist requests remove the emotional friction that makes PR feel heavy. You're not wondering whether now is the right time, whether your email is annoying, or whether you've misunderstood a journalist's beat. The journalist has already raised their hand. You're responding to demand, not manufacturing interest.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The trade-off is speed. These opportunities move fast, and once a journalist has enough sources, the window closes. Live requests reward founders who are visible, prepared, and able to respond concisely without overthinking.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Relevance is pre-qualified by the journalist</li>
    <li>Clear timing and intent</li>
    <li>Significantly higher response and inclusion rates</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Short response windows</li>
    <li>Requires quick, focused replies</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Founder reality:</strong> This is the fastest and calmest route to press coverage because the hard parts, relevance and timing, are already solved.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">20. One System Beats Twenty Tabs</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Most founders don't fail at PR because they're bad at it.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    They fail because journalist discovery is scattered, fragmented, and mentally exhausting. Twitter in one tab. Google News in another. A couple of journalist request emails piling up in the inbox. Maybe a spreadsheet somewhere that felt organised for about a week. None of it broken on its own, but together it turns PR into something that constantly pulls at your attention.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When discovery, outreach, and journalist requests live in different places, PR becomes hard to sustain. Not technically hard, just cognitively heavy. Every action requires context switching. Every opportunity feels easy to miss. And over time, guessing becomes the default state.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's the real problem most founders are dealing with.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If there's one thing I hope this guide has made clear, it's that finding journalists covering your niche doesn't need to feel chaotic.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>You don't need to be everywhere.</strong><br />
    You don't need to chase every platform.<br />
    And you definitely don't need to turn PR into a full-time job just to get a few replies.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The founders who get press coverage consistently aren't doing more. They're doing less guessing.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    They know which journalists actually cover their niche.<br />
    They can see opportunities when they appear.<br />
    And they use a system that keeps everything contained, so PR fits into running a business rather than competing with it.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's exactly why I built <a href="/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Instead of bouncing between Twitter, Google News, journalist request emails, and spreadsheets, you can find journalists covering your niche, explore a live journalist database, and respond to real journalist requests from one calm dashboard. No agency contracts. No complicated workflows. Just clearer visibility into who's writing about what, right now.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">

    It feels calmer and more intentional.<br />
    And it becomes a channel you can actually sustain alongside everything else you're building.
