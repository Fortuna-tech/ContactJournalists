      There is a better time of day to email journalists.<br/>

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Most founders don't struggle with PR because their pitch is bad. They struggle because they're guessing. Guessing who to email, guessing when to email them, guessing whether silence means "not interested" or "wrong moment".

  <section id="hello" class="my-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Hi, I'm Fortuna 👋</h2>
    
    <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6 mb-8 items-start">
      <img src="/assets/fortuna-founder-balloons.jpg" alt="Fortuna, founder of ContactJournalists.com" class="w-32 md:w-40 flex-shrink-0 rounded-2xl shadow-lg" />
      <div class="flex-1">
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          Before I built <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a> I ran a supplement brand called It Really Works Vitamins. PR wasn't part of some grand plan. It showed up when other channels became unreliable and I needed something steadier. Something I didn't have to keep feeding money into just to stay visible.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          The frustrating part wasn't writing pitches. It was the unbelievable decision fatigue. Sitting there wondering whether <em>now</em> was the right moment to send, whether I'd missed my window, whether silence meant disinterest or bad timing. That quiet, nagging uncertainty is what made PR feel heavier than it needed to be.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Timing became one of those things I obsessed over because it felt controllable. And that's exactly why founders end up searching for things like <em>best time to email journalists</em> or <em>when do reporters read emails</em>. Let's talk about what actually matters and dive in!

  <section id="why-timing" class="my-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Why Timing Becomes a Fixation for Founders</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Founders fixate on timing because it feels like a rule you can follow. Send at 8am. Avoid Fridays. Don't email on Mondays. It gives PR a sense of structure when everything else feels vague.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      But journalists don't experience email the way founders do.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      They're not opening pitches with curiosity and time to spare. They're scanning quickly, deciding what's relevant, and moving on. Often under pressure, often between deadlines.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is why PR feels random when you don't have visibility. You're making decisions without context. Timing does matter, but it's only one small part of a much bigger picture.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is also why tools like <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a> exist. When you can see who is relevant and who is actively open to sources, timing stops being a source of stress and becomes a small optimisation instead.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      There's a 7-day free trial if you want to explore that later, but first, let's look at the data!
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="data" class="my-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">What the Data Says About Emailing Journalists</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      If you zoom out and look at how journalists actually work, the data isn't surprising at all.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Journalists talk openly about inbox overload and how quickly they have to make decisions. <a href="https://muckrack.com/state-of-journalism" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muck Rack's State of Journalism report</a> regularly shows that relevance and speed are the biggest factors in what gets opened, replied to, or quietly ignored. It's not about reading everything, it's about spotting what's useful right now.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      The same theme shows up in <a href="https://www.cision.com/resources/articles/media-pitching-best-practices/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cision's pitching research</a>. Emails sent earlier in the day tend to perform better, not because journalists are more relaxed, but because their inbox is still manageable. Once the day fills up with edits, meetings, and deadlines, even good pitches are easier to miss.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Even broader email studies, like <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-time-send-email" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot's work on send times</a>, point in the same direction. Early emails get seen more often simply because they arrive before the noise ramps up.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      None of this means timing guarantees coverage. It just explains why some emails get a fair glance, and others never really stand a chance.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      So when exactly is the best time of the day to email journalists?
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="morning" class="my-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Morning Emails: Why They Consistently Perform Best</h2>
    
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-accent-mint mb-4">Best window: roughly 6:30am–9:30am (journalist's local time)</p>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is the most reliable window for emailing journalists, and it's not because journalists are early risers who love pitches with their coffee. It's because this is the brief moment in the day when their inbox is still decipherable.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      In the morning, journalists are typically:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">✓</span>
        <span>Scanning overnight emails for anything genuinely relevant</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">✓</span>
        <span>Checking replies to source requests they posted the day before</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">✓</span>
        <span>Filling gaps in articles already planned for the day</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">✓</span>
        <span>Making quick keep-or-kill decisions before meetings and edits take over</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      According to <a href="https://muckrack.com/state-of-journalism" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muck Rack's State of Journalism report</a>, relevance and speed are the two biggest factors in whether a pitch is even considered. Journalists simply don't have the luxury of reading everything. They skim, decide, and move on. Early emails benefit because they arrive before the inbox turns into triage.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Morning emails work because the mental load is lower. Once the day gets going, the cost of switching attention becomes too high, even for good pitches.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Looking back at my own pitching while running It Really Works Vitamins, the pattern was obvious. Most real replies came from early sends. Not because those emails were smarter or better written, but because they arrived before everything else competed for attention.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">

  <section id="afternoon" class="my-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Afternoon Emails: When They Still Work (and Why They Often Don't)</h2>
    
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-400 mb-4">Window: roughly 12pm–3pm</p>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is where things become less forgiving.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      By the afternoon, most journalists are deep into execution mode. Writing, editing, fact-checking, responding to editors, chasing quotes. Your email isn't being read slowly, it's being pattern-matched in seconds.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      <a href="https://www.cision.com/resources/articles/media-pitching-best-practices/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cision's pitching research</a> shows a clear drop in open and response rates after late morning. Not because pitches suddenly get worse, but because attention becomes fragmented and deadlines start to dominate decision-making.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That said, afternoon emails can still work when the context is right.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      They tend to perform best if:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>You are replying directly to a journalist request</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>The pitch is extremely on-beat and immediately usable</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>You are clearly saving the journalist time, not adding to their workload</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is exactly why responding to journalist requests is such a game-changer. You're not interrupting their flow, you're supporting it. You're answering a question they've already asked.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is also where <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a> changes the experience completely. Instead of having your inbox open, Twitter open, tabs everywhere, and that constant low-level anxiety about missing something, everything lives inside one calm dashboard. You can see live journalist requests, respond immediately, and then close the tab.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      No guessing. No refreshing. No wondering if now is the "right" time.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      You're replying from a place of clarity, directly to a journalist who has already said, "I need this." That alone removes a huge amount of stress, and it's why founders often say their head feels quieter after a few days on the platform.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">A Quick (Relevant) Detour: What I Learned About Timing From My Own Customers</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Very quick side note, because this genuinely shaped how I think about timing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      When I was running It Really Works Vitamins, I used to send promotional emails to our own mailing list at very specific times. One that worked ridiculously well was 7pm on a Sunday UK time, and 7pm New York time for our US list, which meant hitting send at midnight UK time.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Even without heavy discounting, those emails consistently outperformed weekday sends. Some included a discount code, but interestingly, a lot of people didn't even use it.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Why? Because timing wasn't about catching people at work. It was about catching them when their head was quiet and they were relaxing on the sofa! Thought I'd let fellow founders know that!

  <section id="evening" class="my-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Now, Back to Journalists: Why Evenings & Weekends Are a Different Game</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Journalists don't operate like customers, and they don't consume email in "downtime" mode.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Most research shows that evening and weekend pitches have lower open and response rates overall, especially for cold outreach. <a href="https://www.cision.com/resources/articles/the-best-time-to-send-a-pr-pitch" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cision's data</a> consistently shows engagement dropping outside standard working hours, particularly for hard news and business desks.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That said, evenings and weekends aren't useless. They're just contextual.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      They tend to work only when:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>You're replying directly to a journalist request (check out our free trial at <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a> to do this)</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>The journalist has posted that request outside normal hours</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>The topic is lifestyle, culture, wellness, consumer trends, or opinion-led</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      <a href="https://muckrack.com/research/the-state-of-journalism" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muck Rack's State of Journalism data</a> backs up the nuance here: journalists are drowning in volume, and they're ruthless about what they engage with, especially outside normal hours. In the 2024 report, 46% of journalists said they receive 6+ pitches per day (so, at least 30 a week), and the number one reason they reject pitches (73%) is simply that it's not relevant to what they cover. "Bad timing" exists, but it's not the main villain. Relevance is.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is the key difference founders miss:
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      <strong>Cold pitching on a Sunday evening</strong> is usually ignored because you're adding to inbox noise at a time when journalists are even less likely to want new inputs.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      <strong>Replying to a journalist who has asked for sources</strong> on a Sunday evening is different. That's not interruption, that's assistance. You're stepping into an existing workflow, not trying to create one.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That distinction matters.

  <section class="my-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Why Live Journalist Requests Change the Timing Equation Completely</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is where PR starts to feel structured rather than performative.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      The timing anxiety completely disappears when you're responding to a live journalist request.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      You're no longer wondering whether your email is too early, too late, or slightly irritating. The journalist has already made their intent clear. They're actively looking for input and here you are replying woohoo!
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is exactly how <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a> is designed to be used.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Inside the dashboard, journalist requests appear as they come in. You can respond from one place, without monitoring your inbox, watching Twitter, or keeping multiple tabs open "just in case." You're not trying to manufacture interest, you're responding to an existing and often urgent need.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That shift may sound small, but it changes how PR feels day to day.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Instead of asking:<br/>
      <em>"Is now the right time to email this journalist?"</em>
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      It becomes:<br/>
      <em>"They're looking for sources right now. I can help."</em>
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Founders often tell me this is the point where PR becomes manageable and really gets into flow. Not something to hype up or dread, just something that fits into the natural cadence of running your start-up!

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Does the Day of the Week Matter?</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Short answer: yes, but less than most founders think.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Day of the week can influence open rates, but it rarely makes or breaks a pitch on its own. Most data shows that <strong>Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday</strong> perform slightly better for journalist outreach. Mondays are often chaotic, with inboxes full and schedules being set. Fridays, especially after midday, tend to fade out as attention shifts to wrapping the week.

      That said, focusing too much on the "perfect" day can become another form of procrastination. A highly relevant pitch sent on a Monday morning will outperform a vague, generic one sent at the ideal time on a Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is why relevance and visibility matter more than calendar rules. When you know a journalist is actively covering your topic or has just requested sources, the day becomes secondary. You're responding to demand, not trying to time the market.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      For founders who want a deeper breakdown of relevance versus timing, this guide connects the dots nicely:

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      And again, this is exactly the gap <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a> is designed to close. When the right journalist is already visible, timing decisions stop feeling like guesswork and start feeling obvious.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Final Thoughts: The Best Time to Email Journalists (Founder to Founder)</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      If there's one thing I hope you take away from this, it's that timing isn't the enemy. <strong>Guessing is.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Most founders aren't bad at PR. They're just trying to make decisions without enough visibility. When you don't know who's relevant, who's actively writing, or who's open to sources right now, every email feels loaded. Every follow-up feels risky. Every silence feels personal.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Once that uncertainty goes away, everything changes.
    </p>
    <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-mint">✓</span>
        <span>Timing stops feeling like a trap.</span>

      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-mint">✓</span>
        <span>Silence stops feeling like rejection.</span>

      <div class="bg-base-800/50 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">What is the best time of day to email journalists?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          The best window is roughly 6:30am–9:30am in the journalist's local time. This is when inboxes are manageable and journalists are making quick decisions before their day fills up with deadlines.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="bg-base-800/50 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Does the day of the week matter when emailing journalists?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Yes, but less than timing. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday tend to perform best. Avoid Friday afternoons and be cautious with Monday mornings when inboxes are crowded.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="bg-base-800/50 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Should I email journalists in the evening or on weekends?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Only if you're replying to a live journalist request. Cold pitches sent during evenings or weekends typically underperform because journalists aren't in "work mode."
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="bg-base-800/50 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Why do morning emails perform better with journalists?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Journalists scan emails quickly in the morning before meetings and deadlines take over. Early emails get seen when mental load is lower and decisions are faster.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="bg-base-800/50 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Does timing guarantee press coverage?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          No. Timing improves your odds of being seen, but relevance is what gets replies. The best-timed pitch in the world won't work if it's sent to the wrong journalist or covers the wrong angle.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="bg-base-800/50 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">How can I stop overthinking when to send my pitch?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          The best way is to respond to live journalist requests instead of cold pitching. When a journalist is actively looking for sources, timing anxiety disappears because you know they want to hear from you right now.
