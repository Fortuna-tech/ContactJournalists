  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If you're a solo founder, PR probably feels like something you're meant to be doing, but never quite get on top of.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That was me when I was building It Really Works Vitamins, a Shopify store I ran largely on my own. I'd outsourced the logistics, warehousing, and shipping because I had to, but everything else sat with me. All the marketing, all the paperwork, all the decisions. I was personally reaching out to influencers, journalists, editors, and anyone who might be a fit, while also keeping the business ticking over day to day. I knew PR mattered. I could see competitors getting quoted and featured, and I could feel the credibility gap opening up in real time. I'd open Twitter with good intentions, tell myself I'd just spend ten minutes on press outreach, and then the day would disappear under emails, admin, supplier issues, and the constant mental load that comes with running a business alone.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    PR ended up living quietly in the background. Not ignored, just never finished. Slightly stressful. Always easy to postpone.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    At the same time, there were bursts of excitement that kept pulling me back in. We sent products to celebrities, Instagram influencers, people with real reach, Men's Health cover models, even Alex Reid, back when that felt like a huge win. That dopamine hit is very real when you're doing founder-led PR yourself. One DM reply, one reshare, one "this could be big" moment and suddenly press coverage feels exciting again.

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    But excitement isn't a system.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What drained me wasn't the work. It was the guessing. Who to contact. Whether to follow up. Whether I was being annoying. Whether I was missing something obvious that everyone else seemed to understand about how to get press without a PR agency.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is the PR playbook I wish I'd had back then. Written for solo founders who are doing their own marketing, their own outreach, and their own press, and who want a way to get media coverage without burning out in the process.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Why PR advice breaks down for solo founders</h2>

  <img src="/assets/stock_images/pr-pic-2.png" alt="Vogue magazine with coffee - media aesthetic" class="w-full rounded-2xl mb-8" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Most PR advice isn't wrong. It's just written for a completely different kind of business.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A lot of it assumes you've got people around you. Someone handling marketing. Someone tracking coverage. Someone building lists, chasing follow-ups, keeping spreadsheets tidy. It also quietly assumes you're running a fairly established brand, with budget to play with and the freedom to treat PR as an experiment rather than something that needs to justify its time.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's not how most founders are operating.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Most businesses are run by one person, or one person with a bit of outsourced help. You're doing the thinking, the decision-making, and the outreach yourself, usually in between everything else that actually keeps the business moving. Which is why so many founders end up Googling things like how to find journalists for my business, reading article after article, and still feeling none the wiser.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I break this down properly here, from a founder's point of view rather than a PR agency's:
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    👉 <a href="/blog/how-to-find-the-right-reporter-for-your-story" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">How to Find the Right Reporter for Your Story</a>
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Solo founders don't struggle with PR because they're bad at it, or because their story isn't interesting enough. They struggle because most PR advice assumes a setup they simply don't have. When you're running things on your own, PR has to fit around the business you're already running, not demand a whole new way of working just to get started.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">PR for solo founders is not broadcasting, it's timing</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The biggest shift that changed everything for me was realising that PR isn't about how many people you contact. It's about when you show up.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When I was running It Really Works Vitamins, I treated PR the same way most solo founders do at the beginning. I assumed it worked like marketing. More outreach meant more chances. So I'd spend time finding journalists, drafting emails, convincing myself my angle was relevant enough, and sending pitches out into the void. Sometimes it worked. Often it didn't. And when it didn't, it left me second-guessing everything. Was the subject line wrong? Was the story boring? Should I have followed up, or should I have left it alone?
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What I didn't understand then was that I was treating PR like broadcasting, when journalists experience it as timing.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Cold pitching everyone "just in case" rarely works, not because your story is bad, but because most journalists simply aren't writing about that thing right now. When you respond to a journalist who is already actively working on a piece, the dynamic completely changes. You're no longer interrupting them. You're helping them do their job.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's why journalist requests matter so much, and why they change the PR equation for solo founders. Instead of guessing who might be interested, you're responding to someone who has already said, publicly, "I need this." I break this shift down properly here, because it's one of the most misunderstood parts of modern PR:
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    👉 <a href="/blog/why-journalist-requests-change-discovery" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">Why Journalist Requests Change Discovery Completely</a>
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is also why so much of the anxiety around PR disappears once founders move to a request-led approach. If you've ever worried about whether it's too early, too late, or just annoying to email a journalist, that stress comes from guessing. When the request is live, that question answers itself. The journalist is already writing. They're already open to sources. You're not bothering them, you're responding.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I see this constantly with founders who ask about the best time to email journalists. The honest answer is that timing matters far less when a journalist has already raised their hand. That's exactly why this guide exists:
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    👉 <a href="/blog/best-time-of-day-to-email-journalists" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">The Best Time of Day to Email Journalists</a>
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Once I understood this, PR stopped feeling like something I had to psych myself up for. It became quieter, more practical, and far less emotional. I wasn't trying to convince people anymore. I was simply showing up when it made sense.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That shift is the entire reason ContactJournalists.com exists. It's built to surface those moments in real time, so you're not guessing who to contact or when. If you're doing PR alone and want it to feel calmer and more predictable, the simplest next step is to see what journalists are already asking for. There's a 7-day free trial, and you'll know very quickly whether this way of doing PR fits how you actually work.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">How journalists actually source stories in 2026</h2>

  <img src="/assets/stock_images/pr-pic-3.png" alt="Journalist working with notebook and laptop" class="w-full rounded-2xl mb-8" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    One thing I didn't fully appreciate at first was just how quickly journalists have to move.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When you're on the outside, it's easy to imagine stories being planned weeks in advance. In reality, a lot of articles are pulled together fast, often under real time pressure. Journalists are juggling multiple pieces at once, dealing with edits, breaking news, and tight deadlines, and when they need a source or a real-world example, they often need it immediately.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's why so much of modern journalism now happens in public. Instead of waiting for pitches to land, journalists ask openly for help. They post requests for founders, experts, opinions, and case studies, sometimes with only a few hours before a piece is due to be filed.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This isn't just a hunch, it's something the industry itself talks about openly. Research from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism shows how much journalists now rely on digital platforms to surface voices quickly, especially when they're working to tight deadlines. The Columbia Journalism Review has also written extensively about how reporters increasingly use social platforms to find real people and real examples, rather than waiting for polished press releases to arrive in their inbox.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    In practice, a large percentage of these requests show up on Twitter and X. That's why founders who understand how journalists actually use the platform have a huge advantage. It's not about posting constantly or building a personal brand. It's about knowing how to respond properly when a journalist is already looking for what you have. I've broken that down step by step here:
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    👉 <a href="/blog/how-to-pitch-journalists-on-twitter" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">How to Pitch to Journalists on Twitter</a>
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I saw this first-hand when I was running It Really Works Vitamins. The press opportunities that went anywhere weren't the ones I forced. They were the ones where I happened to catch a journalist at the exact moment they were working on something relevant. The replies were faster, the tone was warmer, and the whole process felt less like pitching and more like having a normal conversation.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The frustrating part for most solo founders isn't that these opportunities don't exist. It's that they're scattered across timelines, emails, newsletters, and posts that disappear quickly if you're not looking at the right moment. Unless PR is your full-time job, it's almost impossible to monitor all of that manually.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's the gap ContactJournalists.com fills. It brings journalist discovery and live requests into one place, so founders like me don't have to rely on luck, constant scrolling, or being "always on" just to spot a genuine opportunity.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">PR without an agency only works if you remove guessing</h2>

  <img src="/assets/stock_images/pr-pic-4.png" alt="Vogue magazine with coffee and gold spoon" class="w-full rounded-2xl mb-8" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Cold outreach feels heavy because it's built on uncertainty at every step.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    You don't know if the journalist is actually relevant to your business. You don't know if they're writing right now or if they last covered your space six months ago. You don't know whether now is a good time to email them, whether they're buried under pitches, or whether you're about to interrupt them at the worst possible moment. And when you don't hear back, you're left guessing again. Was the angle wrong? Was the timing off? Should you follow up, or does that just make you annoying?
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That constant second-guessing is what makes PR exhausting for solo founders. Not the writing. Not the outreach itself. The mental load of not knowing where you stand.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When you respond to a live journalist request, all of that disappears.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The journalist has already said what they're working on. They've already said what they need. They're already open to sources. You're no longer trying to convince someone to care, you're helping them finish a piece they're actively writing. The tone is different, the response rate is different, and the whole interaction feels calmer and more human.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is exactly why founders who move to a request-led approach often say PR suddenly feels manageable. Follow-ups stop feeling awkward because the context is clear. Silence stops feeling personal because you're not pitching blindly anymore. I've written about that shift in detail here, because it's one of the biggest mindset changes founders struggle with:
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    👉 <a href="/blog/why-following-up-matters-and-how-often-to-do-it" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">Why Following Up Matters (And How Often to Do It)</a>
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is also where ContactJournalists.com becomes genuinely useful, not just "another PR tool".
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Instead of guessing who might be relevant, the platform shows you journalists who are actively looking for input right now. Instead of trawling Twitter, newsletters, inboxes, and outdated media lists, you see live journalist requests in one place. Instead of spending time researching whether someone is a fit, that relevance is already clear before you even start typing.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For solo founders, that changes everything.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>ContactJournalists.com helps you:</strong>
  </p>

  <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
    <li>See live journalist requests as they happen, not hours later when the window has closed</li>
    <li>Identify journalists, bloggers, podcasters, and newsletter writers who are actively covering your niche</li>
    <li>Respond quickly while timing is still on your side</li>
    <li>Avoid pitching people who were never going to be a fit</li>
    <li>Keep PR contained in one system, so it doesn't sprawl across tabs, spreadsheets, and half-written drafts</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Most importantly, it removes the emotional weight from PR. You're not chasing attention. You're responding to demand. You're not wondering whether to send the email. You're deciding whether you can genuinely help.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When you're doing PR without an agency, that clarity is the difference between PR feeling like a constant background stress and something you can actually fit around running your business.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If you're a solo founder and PR currently feels heavy, it's almost never because you're doing it wrong. It's because you're doing it without enough visibility. Removing the guessing is the unlock, and that's exactly what ContactJournalists.com was built to do.

  <img src="/assets/stock_images/pr-pic-5.png" alt="Professional podcast microphone on desk - media setup" class="w-full rounded-2xl mb-8" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Everything in this guide really comes back to one simple idea I wish I'd understood much earlier. PR works best when you stop chasing it and start monitoring what's already happening, when you respond to journalists who are already looking for something rather than broadcasting your story to everyone, and when you keep PR contained in one place instead of letting it spill across tabs, notes, and half-finished drafts.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That might sound subtle, but in practice it changes everything. When I was trying to do PR alongside running a business, the thing that drained me wasn't the outreach itself, it was how scattered it all felt. Twitter half-open in the background, newsletters piling up, journalists bookmarked "for later", ideas sitting in my head instead of anywhere useful. Nothing ever felt finished, and PR never really switched off.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That fragmentation is exactly why PR becomes exhausting for solo founders. You're not just doing the work, you're carrying it around mentally all day.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is why one system beats twenty tabs, every single time. I've written about this pattern in more detail here, because it's something I see founders struggle with constantly:
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    👉 <a href="/blog/one-system-beats-twenty-tabs" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">One System Beats Twenty Tabs</a>
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When I talk about having a system, I don't mean anything complicated or corporate. I mean something that lets you look at PR, make a clear decision, and then move on. One place where journalist requests live. One place where you decide whether something is a genuine fit. One place where you can mentally close the loop once you've responded.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's exactly how I built ContactJournalists.com. I didn't want another tool that added noise. I wanted something that acted as a monitoring layer, so I wasn't constantly checking Twitter or skimming newsletters or wondering if I'd missed something important. The goal was simple: see what journalists are actually asking for, respond where it makes sense, and then get back to running the business.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When PR lives in one place and gets checked at a regular rhythm, it stops being this constant background noise. You're not second-guessing yourself all day. You know you've looked. You know you've responded where it was relevant. And that alone makes PR feel manageable instead of draining.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's what the Calm PR System is really about. Not doing more PR. Not chasing coverage. Not turning outreach into another full-time job. Just having a setup that fits how solo founders actually work.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">A realistic weekly PR routine for solo founders</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    PR should not dominate your calendar. If it does, it usually means something has gone wrong with the way it's set up.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A realistic PR routine for a solo founder is small and contained. It's a short daily check, not a long weekly task. You log in, see whether any journalist requests are genuinely relevant to your business, respond to the ones that clearly fit, and consciously ignore everything else. There's no forcing angles, no trying to make yourself relevant to stories that aren't quite right, and no guilt about skipping opportunities that don't make sense.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is exactly how PR starts to fit around running a business instead of competing with it. You're not "doing PR" for hours at a time. You're making quick, confident decisions based on what's actually in front of you. Over time, those small, consistent actions compound. One response turns into a quote, a quote turns into credibility, and credibility makes the next opportunity easier to act on.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This approach is how founders use PR to drive early growth without burning out or turning outreach into another full-time job. I've broken that down in more detail here, with real examples of how founders apply this week to week:
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Common PR mistakes solo founders make</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Most PR mistakes don't come from laziness or bad strategy. They come from good intentions mixed with a lack of clarity.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When you're doing PR on your own, it's very easy to pitch the wrong journalists simply because you're trying to make progress. You convince yourself an angle is "close enough". You spend time explaining why you're relevant because, deep down, you're not entirely sure the fit is obvious. You wait too long to respond to opportunities because you're trying to get the wording perfect. And when you don't hear back, you start treating silence as a personal rejection rather than what it usually is, timing or volume on the journalist's side.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I made every one of these mistakes while running my own business. Not because I didn't care, but because I didn't have enough visibility. When you don't know who's actively writing, who's open to sources, or what a journalist actually needs right now, every pitch feels like a small gamble. That uncertainty is what leads to overthinking, hesitation, and follow-ups that feel awkward instead of natural.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is also why PR advice can feel so conflicting. One article tells you to follow up aggressively. Another tells you to leave journalists alone. Without context, both feel risky. With context, they make sense. When relevance and timing are clear, these decisions become much easier.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If this section feels uncomfortably familiar, you'll probably recognise yourself in this breakdown. It goes into these mistakes in detail and explains how to avoid them without swinging to the opposite extreme:

  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">What PR success actually looks like</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When I first started doing PR, I assumed success would be obvious. I thought it would show up as one big moment, a feature I could screenshot, a spike I could point to and say, "that worked". That's certainly how PR is usually sold to founders, and I bought into that idea for a long time.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That wasn't my experience.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When I look back at what actually made a difference while I was running my business, it wasn't one article that changed everything overnight. It was much quieter than that. A quote here, a mention there, a journalist recognising my name the next time I replied to a request. None of those moments felt dramatic on their own, but together they started to add up.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Over time, something subtle shifted. Journalists trusted me because I'd been helpful before. My name started appearing alongside topics I genuinely knew about. People would reference coverage I'd almost forgotten about in conversations weeks later. From the outside, it probably looked like momentum. From the inside, it just felt like consistently showing up in the right places.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's what PR success actually looks like, especially for solo founders. It's visibility that builds slowly rather than spikes and disappears. It's credibility that compounds quietly. It's mentions and backlinks that stack up over months, sometimes without you even realising it's happening.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is also why PR works best as part of a system, not something you dip in and out of when you "have time". When PR is treated as a regular, contained habit, it compounds almost without effort. When it's done in frantic bursts, it rarely sticks. A lot of earned media research backs this up too. Both Moz and Ahrefs have written extensively about how earned mentions and backlinks build long-term authority in a way paid campaigns simply don't. It's slower, but it's far more durable, and it keeps working long after the original coverage is published.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What I like about this kind of PR success is that it suits how solo founders actually work. You don't need to chase headlines or manufacture news constantly. You don't need PR to feel exciting. You just need it to be reliable. Something that fits around the business you're already running, not something that competes with it for your attention.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That realisation is what led me to build ContactJournalists.com.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I wanted a way to spot the right moments without living on Twitter, without second-guessing myself, and without carrying PR around in my head all day. Something that quietly surfaces opportunities, lets you respond when it genuinely makes sense, and then allows you to move on. No drama. No pressure. Just consistency.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's really what ContactJournalists.com supports. This slower, steadier version of PR. The kind that compounds over time. The kind that suits solo founders. The kind where you look back six months later and realise your name, your brand, and your credibility are showing up in far more places than you expected.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Nothing flashy. Just quietly effective.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Frequently asked questions: PR for solo founders</h2>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Do solo founders actually need a PR agency?</h3>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The honest answer is no, at least not at the beginning. Agencies can be useful later on, when you've got momentum, budget, and a clear sense of what works for you. Early on, though, relevance and speed matter far more than polish. If you can see what journalists are actively looking for and respond quickly when there's a genuine fit, you're already doing the most important part of PR well. An agency doesn't magically fix relevance, and it can't respond faster than someone who's already inside the business.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Is PR worth it for Shopify businesses or smaller brands?</h3>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    From my own experience, especially in trust-driven categories like ecommerce, supplements, wellness, and consumer products, PR can be incredibly effective. When you're selling something people ingest, apply to their skin, or spend real money on, credibility matters. Seeing a founder quoted, a brand mentioned, or a product referenced in the right context builds trust in a way ads simply don't. It's not about mass exposure, it's about being visible in places that signal legitimacy.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">How often should I be pitching journalists?</h3>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Founders tend to overestimate how often they should be pitching journalists. Most people think the answer is "regularly". In reality, it's much less than that. Constant pitching usually leads to forced angles and low response rates. Responding, on the other hand, works because the demand already exists. When a journalist has asked for something and you can genuinely help, that interaction is easier, quicker, and far more likely to go somewhere. Fewer messages, better timing, better outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">How to start without overthinking it</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    You don't need a perfect pitch to get started with PR. You don't need a big announcement. You don't need to wait until you feel "ready".
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That mindset is usually what keeps founders stuck.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What actually helps is visibility. Knowing who is writing right now. Knowing what they're looking for. Knowing when it makes sense to step in, and when it doesn't. Once you have that, everything else gets simpler.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's exactly what ContactJournalists.com is designed to give you. It shows you live journalist requests and active opportunities in one place, so you can respond when there's a clear fit and ignore everything else without guilt.
