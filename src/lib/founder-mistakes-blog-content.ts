    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      I spent seven years building, scaling, and selling a supplement company.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      PR worked, but figuring out how to pitch journalists properly took far more time and energy than it should have.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Not because writing a pitch is hard.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      But because finding the right journalist, at the right moment, with the right angle is difficult without a clear system.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Most founders don't fail at PR because they're bad at writing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      They fail because they're guessing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">

        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          I'm Fortuna, the founder of ContactJournalists.com.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          Before this platform existed, I founded a supplement company called It Really Works Vitamins. I built it from scratch, bootstrapped, over seven stressful years, scaled it myself, and eventually sold the business. (yay!)
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          Like most founders, I didn't start out caring about PR. Early growth came from Instagram and influencer marketing (we were excited to even have Cage Fighter (and former hubby of Katie Price) Alex Reid sharing us on Twitter woohoo!)
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      I built relationships with creators, sent products, worked closely with them, and for a long time, it worked brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Then the algorithm changed. (cue a small sad violin playing 🎻)
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Reach dropped unless you paid. Ads became really expensive. Margins tightened. And suddenly, a platform I didn't own was deciding how visible my business could be!
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That's when PR really stopped being "nice to have" and became completely essential!
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      We eventually landed features in Forbes, Men's Health, and Coach Magazine.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This Forbes feature was a genuine turning point for us:
      <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leebelltech/2019/04/27/best-nutrition-innovation-2019/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.forbes.com/sites/leebelltech/2019/04/27/best-nutrition-innovation-2019/</a>

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      What people don't see is how slow, messy, and mentally draining it was to get there.

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Journalists are so overwhelmed - everyone is pitching them.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Muck Rack's State of Journalism report shows journalists receive huge volumes of pitches, with relevance being the primary factor in what gets opened or ignored:
      <a href="https://muckrack.com/state-of-journalism" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://muckrack.com/state-of-journalism</a>
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      At the same time, the Reuters Institute shows shrinking newsrooms and faster publishing cycles:

    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This means that founders are pitching into an environment where speed, clarity, and relevance matter far more than polish.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      With that context, let's look at the mistakes that slow founders down most.

    <article class="mb-12 p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 1: Pitching the publication instead of the journalist</h3>
      <img src="/assets/pexels-element5-973408_1763117889746.jpg" alt="Person researching journalists" class="w-full rounded-xl mb-4 shadow-lg" />
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Founders often start with the logo they want and work backwards.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        "I want Forbes" turns into clicking random bylines and hoping someone still covers the topic.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        This feels logical, but it's one of the biggest time drains in PR.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Journalists cover beats, not brands. Pitching the wrong journalist doesn't just fail quietly, it often guarantees future emails will be ignored.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The Society of Professional Journalists is clear that beat relevance is fundamental to responsible reporting:
        <a href="https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp</a>
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The faster you can identify who actually covers your niche, the faster PR becomes manageable!
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300">
        Annoyingly this isn't something you can rush, you'll really have to take your time to research journalists and take a look at what writer has published, the topics they cover - as well as their unique style - thankfully this is something made a million times easier with ContactJournalists.com: our giant database of journalists, influencers and podcasters - filter by niche and respond to journalists live requests as soon as they come in!

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 2: Sending a pitch that could literally be sent to anyone</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Most founders write one solid pitch and reuse it, and personalisation is just an afterthought.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Journalists can tell instantly - If a pitch doesn't answer why me, it really feels like noise.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Cision's research shows personalisation directly affects response rates:
        <a href="https://www.cision.com/resources/articles/media-pitching-best-practices/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cision.com/resources/articles/media-pitching-best-practices/</a>
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        This is why seeing what journalists are actively writing about makes such a difference. It turns personalisation into alignment, not extra work.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 3: Writing a company update instead of a story</h3>
      <img src="/assets/pexels-fotios-photos-1358390_1763117889747.jpg" alt="Writing a compelling story" class="w-full rounded-xl mb-4 shadow-lg" />
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Founders default to pitching launches, funding rounds, or "exciting news" because it feels safe (and it's something you obviously know a lot about)
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Journalists don't exist to amplify company updates. They exist to serve readers.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Harvard Business Review explains why stories outperform announcements in attention and recall:

      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        <strong>What works instead:</strong><br />
        Frame your pitch around trends, insights, data, or problems people are already experiencing. Your company supports the story, it isn't the headline!

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 4: Burying the angle under too much context</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        This is one I personally struggled with for a long time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        When I first started pitching journalists, I felt like I had to explain everything upfront. Who I was, how I built the business, why the timing mattered, why this story was different. By the time I reached the actual point, the email was already too long.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        That usually came from insecurity rather than ego. I wanted to make sure the journalist understood why the story mattered before stating what the story actually was.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The problem is that journalists don't read pitches like founders do. They scan. If the angle isn't clear almost immediately, the pitch gets mentally parked for "later", which in practice often means never.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The Poynter Institute consistently teaches clarity-first writing for newsrooms, because journalists are making decisions quickly under pressure:

      <p class="text-slate-300">
        Seeing how journalists phrase their own requests makes it much easier to lead with the point, which is exactly what ContactJournalists.com exposes you to.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 5: Making journalists do detective work</h3>
      <img src="/assets/pexels-shkrabaanthony-5292268_1763117889749.jpg" alt="Frustrated journalist at computer" class="w-full rounded-xl mb-4 shadow-lg" />
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        For a long time, I assumed that if a journalist was interested, they'd click through, Google the brand, or connect the dots themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        They won't.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Journalists are juggling multiple deadlines, inboxes, and stories at once. If it's not immediately clear who you are, why you're credible, and what you're offering, even a good pitch becomes easy to skip.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        I've seen founders lose opportunities simply because they didn't include a clear credibility line, or because the journalist had to work too hard to understand where the quote or insight was coming from.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Muck Rack's State of Journalism report highlights relevance and clarity as major factors in whether pitches are opened and acted on:

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 6: Pitching something that isn't timely</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        This one is especially frustrating, because it often happens even when the story itself is strong.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        I've pitched genuinely good ideas that went nowhere simply because the moment had passed. By the time I hit send, the conversation had already moved on or the article had already been written.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        PR is far more time-sensitive than most founders realise. Timing often matters more than polish, and sometimes more than the idea itself.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The Reuters Institute's Digital News Report shows how much pressure journalists are under to publish quickly and continuously:

    <article class="mb-12 p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 7: Sounding like a press release</h3>
      <img src="/assets/pexels-myatezhny39-2927585_1763117889747.jpg" alt="Journalist reading press materials" class="w-full rounded-xl mb-4 shadow-lg" />
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        When I was tired, overwhelmed, or unsure, I defaulted to formal language. It felt safer. More professional. More "PR-like".
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        In reality, it worked against me.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Press-release language feels slow and impersonal in fast-moving newsrooms. Journalists don't want something that sounds like it's been approved by five people, they want something they can actually use.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Journalists have been openly critical of press-release-style pitching for years, including at The Guardian:
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/09/pr-industry-press-releases" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/09/pr-industry-press-releases</a>
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300">
        Regularly reading real journalist requests is one of the fastest ways to unlearn this habit, and you can do that during the <a href="/auth" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">7-day free trial on ContactJournalists.com</a> if it's helpful.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 8: Not proving credibility quickly enough</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Early on, I assumed that having a legitimate business was enough, that journalists would take the time to understand the background once they were interested.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        In practice, journalists need to justify including you very quickly. If your credibility isn't obvious in the first few lines, they often move on to someone whose expertise is easier to place.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        This isn't personal, it's practical.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Edelman's Trust Barometer consistently shows how much people rely on perceived expertise and third-party validation when deciding what to trust:

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Mistake 9: Following up badly, or not at all</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        I've been on both ends of this.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Sometimes I followed up too aggressively because I felt anxious about being ignored. Other times I didn't follow up at all because I didn't want to be annoying.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Neither approach is ideal.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        PR is timing, not persistence. A polite follow-up can help if timing was off, but excessive chasing rarely changes a journalist's mind.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300">
        When relevance and timing are right, follow-ups often become unnecessary, and seeing that dynamic play out in real time is something founders notice quickly when using the <a href="/auth" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">7-day free trial on ContactJournalists.com</a>.

      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Twitter can be incredibly useful for PR, but it operates on different rules.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        I've seen founders write long, detailed replies to journalist tweets that clearly asked for short, specific responses. The mismatch is obvious immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Tone, brevity, and instructions matter more on Twitter than almost anywhere else.

        In reality, PR compounds. One good feature builds trust, which makes the next one easier. Over time, everything downstream works harder.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Final thoughts, from me to you</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Overall most of what made PR exhausting for me had nothing to do with writing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      It was the mental noise.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      When I was building It Really Works Vitamins, my head was constantly spinning: Instagram tabs open, Twitter in the background. Drafts half-written. Wondering if I'd pitched the wrong person, the right person at the wrong time, or if I'd just said the wrong thing altogether! PR felt important, but it never felt calm - I was just a constant ball of stress.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      And when you're running a business, anything that feels chaotic gets pushed down the list.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Once I started understanding how journalists actually work, what they look for, how quickly decisions are made, and how much relevance and timing matter, everything calmed down: PR stopped feeling like a crazy dark art and started feeling manageable.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That experience is exactly why I built ContactJournalists.com.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Not to "do PR for you", but to remove the guesswork that drains founders. To make it easier to see who's relevant, who's actively looking for stories, and when it's actually worth hitting send.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-8">FAQs: Pitching Journalists as a Founder</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6">
      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Why do most founders struggle to get press coverage?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          Most founders don't struggle because their business is boring or their writing is bad. They struggle because they pitch the wrong journalists, at the wrong time, with no visibility into who actually wants stories right now.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          PR fails when relevance and timing are missing. Journalists receive a huge volume of pitches every day, so if your story doesn't clearly match what they already cover, it's ignored no matter how good it is. This is why many founders feel like PR is "random" or "luck-based", when in reality it's about targeting and speed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">What is the biggest mistake founders make when pitching journalists?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          The biggest mistake is starting with publications instead of people.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Founders often think "I want Forbes" or "I want TechCrunch", then work backwards trying to guess who might care. This wastes time and leads to irrelevant pitches. PR works best when you identify journalists who already write about your niche regularly and are actively publishing. When the fit is right, pitching feels natural instead of forced.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Do I need a PR agency to get press coverage?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          No. Many early-stage founders get press without a PR agency.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Agencies can be helpful in some cases, but they're expensive and often unnecessary if you're willing to be hands-on. What founders really need is a clear way to find relevant journalists, see who is open to sources, and respond quickly to opportunities. That's exactly why ContactJournalists.com exists, to give founders access to journalists and live press requests without agency fees.

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">How many journalists should I pitch for one story?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          Quality beats quantity every time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Pitching 10 to 30 highly relevant journalists usually performs far better than emailing hundreds of generic contacts. Journalists can tell immediately when a pitch isn't meant for them. A small, focused list increases reply rates, saves time, and avoids burning relationships.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Should I send a press release or a pitch email?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          In most cases, send a pitch email.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Press releases are often too long, too formal, and written from a company-first perspective. Journalists prefer short, clear pitches that explain the story, why it matters now, and why you're a credible source. Only send a press release if a journalist specifically asks for one or if there's a genuine need for a formal announcement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">How long should a journalist pitch be?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          Shorter than you think.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Most effective pitches are 100 to 200 words. Journalists scan quickly, so the story needs to be clear in the first few lines. If they're interested, they'll reply and ask for more information.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Why don't journalists reply, even when my pitch feels relevant?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          Silence doesn't always mean disinterest.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Journalists work under tight deadlines, juggle multiple stories at once, and receive more pitches than they can respond to. Sometimes your email arrives at the wrong moment, even if the story is a good fit. This is why timing and live press requests matter so much. When a journalist has already asked for sources, you're not interrupting them, you're helping them do their job.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">How quickly should I respond to a journalist request?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          As quickly as you realistically can.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Journalist requests often fill fast, sometimes within hours. Responding early dramatically increases your chances of being included. Speed matters more than perfection. A clear, relevant response beats a perfectly polished one sent too late.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Is it okay to follow up with journalists?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          Yes, but carefully.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          One polite follow-up after a few working days is fine. Two follow-ups max, only if the story is still timely. If there's no response after that, move on. PR is about timing, not persistence at all costs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-6 bg-base-800/30 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Can PR actually drive sales, or is it just for brand awareness?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          PR can absolutely drive sales.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Press builds trust faster than ads because it comes from third-party validation. When people discover your business through coverage, they arrive warmer, trust you quicker, and convert more easily. PR also supports partnerships, retail conversations, fundraising, and long-term brand credibility. Its impact compounds over time.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">What kind of businesses can use ContactJournalists.com?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          ContactJournalists.com is built for founders, startups, solopreneurs, and small teams who want to get press without hiring a PR agency.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          It works across industries including SaaS, ecommerce, consumer brands, health, wellness, fintech, creator businesses, and more. If journalists write about your space, the platform helps you find them and respond when opportunities appear.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-3">How is ContactJournalists.com different from Googling journalists or using Twitter?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-3">
          Google shows history, not intent. You're guessing whether someone still covers the topic or is open to pitches.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Twitter moves fast and requires constant attention, which most founders don't have time for. ContactJournalists.com brings live journalist requests and relevant contacts into one place, so you're not guessing, scrolling endlessly, or missing opportunities because you weren't online at the right moment.
