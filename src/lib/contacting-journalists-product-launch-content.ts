  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-6">A quick note before we start</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Hello! I'm Fortuna, and before building ContactJournalists.com I spent years on the other side of this problem as the founder of It Really Works Vitamins.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I've launched products with no audience, with a growing customer base with money in the bank, and while quietly panicking about cashflow. I've done PR badly, awkwardly, too late, too early, and occasionally in a way that actually worked.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This article isn't theory: It's written from inside that exact moment where you've launched, or you're about to, and someone has casually said, "You should contact journalists," without explaining how that fits into your strategy (if you have a clear one).
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Before we get into it, if PR already feels like something that's going to live rent-free in your head for the next few weeks, that's exactly why ContactJournalists.com exists. It lets you see live journalist requests, understand who is actively writing, and respond without cold emailing or guessing. There's a 7-day free trial, which is long enough to see whether it actually reduces stress instead of adding another tool to the pile. <a href="/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">Start your 7 day free trial today</a> and check out the live requests that journalists have right now.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">TL;DR</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-0">
      Product launch PR feels awful because founders and journalists are working to completely different clocks. Most launch outreach fails quietly, not because the product is boring, but because it's sent when journalists aren't looking. When you stop treating PR like an announcement and start treating it like timing plus relevance, it becomes calmer, more predictable, and far less personal.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">Summary</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-0">
      This guide explains what contacting journalists during a product launch really feels like from a founder's perspective, why silence from journalists is not a verdict on you or your business, how most founders unintentionally sabotage launch PR, and what actually changed when I stopped guessing and started paying attention to journalist demand.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">Who this is written for</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is for founders launching a product without a PR agency, without a comms team, and without the headspace to spend weeks "doing PR properly." If you're juggling operations, customers, money, and about ten other invisible responsibilities, this is written for you.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">What product launches actually feel like as a founder</h2>

  <img src="/assets/product-launch-pr-3.png" alt="Woman arranging items in minimalist space - founder at work" class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-48 md:w-56" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When I was running It Really Works Vitamins, product launches didn't feel exciting or celebratory. They felt like my brain was permanently switched on, stuck in a low-level stress loop that didn't turn off when work technically ended. Everything felt urgent at once. The product itself, the money already spent, the pressure to make it land properly, and the gnawing fear that it might all just disappear without enough people actually hearing about it, so I know exactly how you feel.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What made it worse was that from the outside, launches are meant to look neat. There's supposed to be a moment where everything goes live, you announce it, people notice, and you move on to the next thing. From the inside, it never feels like that - it feels very messy and exposed. You've already lived with this product in your head for months and now it's getting very real, you know all its flaws, you remember every compromise you had to make along the way, and now you're meant to present it confidently to the world as if it arrived fully formed.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    There's also a strange isolation that comes with launches when you're the founder. You can talk to friends or family about being busy, but you can't really explain the specific kind of pressure that comes from knowing that this one thing needs to work - (and also quite frankly, even the most patient family members or friends want to hear you bleating on about your work) Even if it's not going to make or break the business overnight, from my own experience - it feels like a big test of. Not just of the product, but of you. Your judgement, your instincts, the choices you made leading up to it.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    PR gets tangled up in all of that very quickly. It's not just another task on a list, it feels like a verdict waiting to happen. If journalists pick it up, maybe you were right to back it. If they don't, it's hard not to take that silence as confirmation of every doubt you've been carrying quietly. That's what no one really prepares you for. Product launch PR doesn't just sit in your calendar, it sits in your head.
  </p>

  <img src="/assets/product-launch-pr-4.png" alt="Designer bag with luxury items - professional aesthetic" class="float-left mr-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-48 md:w-56" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I remember launches where I'd technically be "done" for the day, but my brain wouldn't switch off. I'd be thinking about whether I'd contacted the right people, whether I'd left it too late, whether I should send one more email or just leave it alone. It's exhausting in a very specific way, because there's no clear action that makes it feel resolved. You either get a response or you don't, and until then, it just hangs there.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That constant mental noise is what makes contacting journalists during a launch feel so uncomfortable. You're already on edge, already stretched thin, and now you're putting something personal out into the world and waiting to see if anyone notices. It's not surprising that so many founders either avoid PR altogether or rush it in a moment of panic, neither of which really helps.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's also why, when people talk about product launches as if they're exciting milestones full of momentum and energy, it can feel oddly alienating. For most founders I know, and certainly for me, launches were more about holding it together, making sure nothing fell apart, and quietly hoping that the work would be seen by the right people at the right time.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    And that feeling is exactly what shapes how founders approach journalists during a launch, often without even realising it.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">Why contacting journalists during a launch feels so uncomfortable</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    What it actually looked like was me sitting there late at night with my laptop open, half-scrolling and half-panicking. I'd Google journalists, click through articles, open Twitter, close it, then open it again. I was constantly second-guessing myself and questioning whether any of this made sense. Did this person still write about supplements? Was the article I was referencing already too old? Was I about to embarrass myself by emailing someone who had no interest in this at all?
  </p>

  <img src="/assets/product-launch-pr-5.png" alt="Skincare products in cocktail glass - creative product shot" class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-48 md:w-56" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I'd start writing an email, delete it, rewrite it, try to make it sound less salesy, then spend far too long picking it apart. After that, I'd worry it had gone too far in the other direction and barely said anything. I'd read it back and wonder whether journalists secretly hated founders, or whether I was just annoying by default, or whether I'd already missed the moment without realising it. Eventually I'd send something that felt acceptable rather than good, more "this will do" than anything I actually felt confident about. Then I'd wait. And nothing would come back.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That silence is brutal when you're already stretched thin.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">The timing mismatch nobody explains</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For a long time, I assumed the problem was my pitch. I kept tweaking wording and subject lines, convinced that if I just found the right phrasing, journalists would reply. What I didn't understand was that the real issue wasn't the email. It was timing.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Founders reach out when a product is ready. Journalists respond when they're actively working on something relevant. Those moments rarely overlap by default.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This isn't a secret. Journalists talk openly about how they source stories. Platforms like Muck Rack and Help a Reporter Out exist because journalists constantly request sources rather than waiting for pitches. Many also use Twitter, now X, as a live sourcing tool, which is well documented by organisations like the Reuters Institute.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Once I understood that, PR stopped feeling mysterious. I wasn't bad at it. I was just emailing at moments when no one was listening.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    I've written more about that shift here:

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">Why "we've launched" usually isn't the story</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This part is uncomfortable but important. A product launch, on its own, is rarely a story. Journalists aren't covering launches for the sake of it. They're covering trends, behaviour changes, gaps in the market, and real-world examples that help explain something bigger.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Some of the strongest coverage I ever got for It Really Works Vitamins barely mentioned the launch itself. It focused on customer behaviour, wider shifts in how people thought about supplements, or problems that kept coming up repeatedly. That kind of coverage lasts longer and gets reused far more than a neat launch announcement ever does.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If this clashes with what you've been told about press releases, this article explains why that advice is outdated:

  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For a broader industry view, the Chartered Institute of Public Relations also publishes guidance showing how much PR has shifted away from announcements and towards relevance-led storytelling.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">How silence from journalists messes with your head</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Silence is the hardest part of product launch PR. Not because it means no, but because it gives you nothing to react to. When you're already under pressure, it's easy to assume the worst.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    In reality, journalists miss emails constantly. They're reassigned, pulled into breaking stories, or simply overloaded. Studies from places like the Tow Center for Digital Journalism consistently show how fragmented journalists' workflows are now.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is why responding to journalist requests feels so different psychologically. When someone has explicitly asked for sources, you're not interrupting them. You're answering a question.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That shift changes everything.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">When product launch PR actually works</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    PR started working for me when I stopped trying to force attention and started paying attention instead. When I responded to things journalists were already asking for, or reached out with context that clearly matched what they were writing, the interaction felt completely different. Replies were calmer, quicker, and far less emotionally loaded.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    At that point, PR stopped feeling like a dramatic moment tied to a launch date. It became something quieter that ran alongside the business rather than hijacking it.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Timing plays a big role here too, and I've broken that down in more detail here:
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 clear-both">Why I built ContactJournalists.com</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    After enough launches, the thing that wore me down wasn't writing emails. It was guessing. Guessing who to contact, when to email, whether to follow up, and what silence actually meant. That constant background stress was worse than the work itself.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    ContactJournalists.com was built to remove that guessing. One place where founders can see live journalist requests, understand relevance quickly, and respond without turning PR into a full-time mental load. It's not about doing more PR. It's about doing it without losing your evenings to panic-Googling.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Contacting Journalists for a Product Launch (A Founder's Real-World Guide)</h2>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If you're in launch mode right now and PR feels overwhelming, it doesn't mean you're late, disorganised, or doing something wrong. It usually just means you're trying to force something to happen at the exact moment you're already under the most pressure. That's a hard place to think clearly from, let alone make good decisions.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    You don't need a perfect pitch or a dramatic announcement to make PR work. You don't need to impress anyone or shout louder. What actually helps is knowing who is already interested in stories like yours and being able to show up calmly when there's a genuine fit. Once that guessing stops, PR stops feeling like a judgement on you or your product and starts feeling like a normal part of running a business.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's the gap ContactJournalists.com was built to fill. Not to turn you into a PR machine, but to give you enough visibility that you're not doing this blindly or burning energy you don't have. There's a 7-day free trial, which is plenty of time to see whether it takes some of the pressure off during moments like this.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    No noise. No chasing. Just a bit more clarity, when you actually need it.

  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If you want to go a bit deeper, or you're trying to sanity-check what you're experiencing during a product launch, these resources are genuinely useful. They're not PR hype pieces, they're written by journalists or organisations that study how newsrooms actually operate.
