      A media list doesn't "work" because it has lots of names in it. It works when it's built around relevance, timing, and proof of coverage fit, which is why most founders get ignored even when their product is genuinely good. Journalists are swimming in pitches, and multiple industry studies show that most pitches are irrelevant, which means journalists become ruthless about filtering and ignoring anything that looks generic, mass-sent, or not clearly tied to their beat.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      A results-driving media list is not a spreadsheet of "top publications." It's a living shortlist of writers who have demonstrated, through recent output, that they cover your exact lane, your exact angle types, and your audience, and who are reachable through the channels they actually prefer. Cision's State of the Media reporting consistently points to relevance, data, and fit as central to whether a pitch gets used, and Muck Rack's guidance reinforces that subject lines and framing work when they signal a story, not admin.

  <h2 id="why-fail" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">1. Why most media lists quietly fail</h2>
  
  <img src="/assets/cozy-laptop-coffee.png" alt="Cozy workspace with laptop and coffee" class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-40 md:w-48" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Most media lists don't "fail" like a marketing channel fails. Ads fail loudly, you see spend, clicks, conversion rate, CAC, and you can decide within days if something's broken. Media lists fail quietly because the failure signal looks like human behaviour: no reply, no open, no acknowledgement, nothing that tells you whether your story was wrong, your target was wrong, or your timing was wrong. That silence makes founders spiral, because the effort is real and the feedback loop is basically non-existent, which is exactly why so many founders either give up on PR completely or swing into mass blasting to numb the feeling. This dynamic is made worse by the broader "PR spam" problem journalists themselves talk about, where irrelevant or templated pitches train writers to filter aggressively and ignore faster.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The bigger reason media lists fail is that founders build them like static assets, but journalism is not static. Editorial priorities shift, beats shift, roles shift, and a writer who was perfect for your story in October may be on a completely different desk by January. Even if they're still on the same beat, their current assignment cycle might make your angle unusable. Cision's State of the Media findings repeatedly highlight that journalists are dealing with heavy inbound volume and time constraints, meaning fit and speed matter more than "perfect formatting." If your list isn't designed to track current fit, it doesn't matter how "professional" the spreadsheet looks, it's already decaying.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 clear-both">
    There's also an uncomfortable truth founders don't want to hear at first: most media lists are built backwards. They start from what the founder wants ("I want Forbes, I want TechCrunch, I want the nationals") instead of what the journalist needs ("I need a clean story angle that fits what I cover, with usable proof, in a format that doesn't waste my time"). The list fails because it's optimized for ego and aspiration rather than editorial compatibility, and compatibility is the only thing that turns a name in a spreadsheet into an actual reply in your inbox.
  </p>

  <h2 id="filtering" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">2. What journalists are actually filtering for (so your list matches reality)</h2>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If you want a media list that gets results, you have to build it around what journalists are filtering for in the first three seconds of seeing your name. This isn't theoretical. Multiple pitching guides and newsroom-facing research repeat the same pattern: journalists reject pitches that aren't relevant to their audience or beat, and they prefer concise, usable pitches with data or strong angles, because time is the bottleneck. Cision's guidance and reporting includes specific stats on what makes journalists reject pitches and what they want included, and it's brutally consistent: relevance and clarity win; generic and fluffy loses.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    So your list can't just be "names." It needs to encode the filters journalists are applying. At minimum, your list should be designed to answer, instantly, for each person: what do they cover, what angle formats do they publish, what proof do they use, what sections do they write for, how do they receive pitches, and what's the most recent piece that proves they're active on this topic. If you can't answer those quickly, your list is basically just a set of lottery tickets. And the reason this matters is the relevance gap: research linked to the State of the Media reporting shows that a very small proportion of pitches are considered relevant, which explains why inbox behaviour is so ruthless.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is also why subject lines and framing matter so much more than founders expect. Muck Rack has published research-led guidance on subject lines based on analysis at scale, emphasising that subject lines work when they signal a story and make relevance obvious, rather than reading like internal admin ("Press Release: New Launch"). That directly connects back to list quality: even the best subject line dies if the journalist isn't a match, and even an okay subject line can work if the match is perfect and timely.

  <h2 id="publication-trap" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">3. The "publication-first" trap (and how it kills results)</h2>
  
  <img src="/assets/cozy-office-imac.png" alt="Beautiful home office with iMac" class="float-left mr-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-40 md:w-48" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Founders love building media lists by publication because it feels concrete. You can point to it. You can tell yourself you're doing "proper PR." You can tick off logos. But that approach quietly sabotages you because publications are not the unit of fit, journalists are. A single publication can contain ten totally different editorial worlds: a consumer desk, a trends desk, an opinion desk, a product desk, a data desk, a startup desk, a personal finance desk. "I want to be in X publication" is not a strategy; it's a destination with no map. The strategy is: "I want writers who repeatedly cover this theme, in this tone, for this audience, and who demonstrably use sources like me."
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A publication-first list also encourages mass blasting, because once you have "20 outlets," the temptation is to email "the outlet" or multiple people inside it, which is one of the fastest ways to get ignored and quietly filtered long term. Muck Rack explicitly warns against sloppy multi-targeting inside the same outlet and emphasises professionalism and relevance as the long-game.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 clear-both">
    If you're a founder, you don't have time to play the numbers game. You need a list built to convert into replies. That means you build it journalist-first, story-format-first, and recency-first, even if that bruises your ego a bit because it might mean your first wins come from smaller outlets that are still extremely valuable for backlinks, authority, and compounding coverage.

  <h2 id="beats" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">4. Beats aren't job titles: how to build lists around what journalists actually write</h2>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A proper media list is built around output, not bios. Bios lie. Not maliciously, but because they lag reality. A journalist might still have "Tech Reporter" in their bio while currently filing mostly about AI policy, or they might have "Lifestyle Writer" while actually doing long investigations into consumer scams. The only reliable indicator is what they've written in the last 90 days, and then what they've written in the last 12 months, and what categories that output clusters around. This is why building a list takes more effort upfront, but saves huge effort later: you stop proving relevance from scratch every time.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Here's the founder-friendly way to define a "beat" for list building, without turning PR into a full-time job:</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li><strong>Topic lane:</strong> what subject repeatedly appears (e.g., founder burnout, ecommerce retention, supplement claims, AI tools for small business).</li>
    <li><strong>Angle lane:</strong> what shape the story takes (data-led trend, founder narrative, consumer warning, product review, "how to," investigative, opinion).</li>
    <li><strong>Audience lane:</strong> who the piece is written for (operators, consumers, parents, small businesses, investors).</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence lane:</strong> what the journalist uses to support claims (first-person examples, surveys, case studies, expert quotes, datasets).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Why this matters is not just "because I said so." It ties directly to what journalist research says they want: relevant sources, usable data, concise pitches, and material that fits the editorial needs of the format they're working in. Cision's reporting and advice repeatedly emphasise data, relevance, and usefulness as major drivers of whether a pitch becomes coverage.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    When you build your media list around these lanes, you stop wasting time pitching someone who technically covers your industry but never writes stories in the format your angle fits. That's the hidden killer: wrong format match looks like "no reply," and founders misdiagnose it as "PR doesn't work."
  </p>

  <h2 id="anatomy" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">5. What a high-performing media list actually looks like (the anatomy)</h2>
  
  <img src="/assets/reading-magazine-beige.png" alt="Person reading magazine in cozy setting" class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-40 md:w-48" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A media list that gets results is not one spreadsheet tab. It's a mini operating system. The goal is not "collect contacts." The goal is "create a repeatable pipeline from story → match → pitch → reply → coverage → follow-on coverage."
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Here's the anatomy of a list that actually performs:</strong>
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">A. The core list (20–60 people max)</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is your shortlist of journalists who are consistent fits. It's small because you need to know it, not just store it. If your list is 400 people long and you can't remember who anyone is, you don't have a list, you have noise.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">B. The opportunistic layer (rotating)</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    These are writers who become relevant when a topic spikes: a seasonal angle, a breaking news cycle, a cultural moment. They're not "always on," but they're worth tracking.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">C. The request-driven layer</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is where modern PR becomes dramatically easier: when a journalist raises their hand and says "I need sources for X." The difference is psychological and practical. Psychologically, it removes the "am I annoying them?" anxiety. Practically, it removes guessing about fit and timing. Cision's reporting on what journalists want and how they use PR content supports that the right content at the right time is what matters, and live requests shortcut that entire problem.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4 clear-both">D. Notes that encode your "why them"</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is what most lists miss. Every contact should have a one-line "why":
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>"Covers ecommerce ops, writes case study style, uses founder quotes"</li>
    <li>"Does consumer health warnings, loves data, writes with sceptical tone"</li>
    <li>"Covers bootstrapped founder stories, prefers email, short intros"</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Without this, you will re-research the same person every time, which is how founders burn out.
  </p>

  <div class="bg-accent-blue/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      <strong>Founders don't need more tools. They need fewer tabs.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">

  <h2 id="step-by-step" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">6. How to build it step-by-step (without turning into a PR intern)</h2>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is the part most PR advice gets wrong because it assumes you have time. You don't. So this is built for founders with limited hours and high cognitive load.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Pick one "press lane" for the next 30 days</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Not "all press." One lane. One. Examples:
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>"Founder experience + behind the scenes"</li>
    <li>"Data-led trend from our customer base"</li>
    <li>"Commentary + expert quotes on a live topic"</li>
    <li>"Consumer warning / myth-busting in our category"</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This matters because journalists are filtering by beat and audience. If you try to pitch multiple lanes at once, your list becomes incoherent, and incoherent lists produce incoherent pitches.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Find 30 recent articles that match your lane</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    You're not collecting journalists yet. You're collecting proof of output. Your job is to find articles that feel like the kind of piece your story would sit beside naturally. That's how you avoid pitching into the void.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Extract the writers and tag them</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For each writer:
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>publication</li>
    <li>article URL</li>
    <li>topic lane</li>
    <li>angle lane</li>
    <li>evidence lane</li>
    <li>recency (days since last relevant piece)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Now you're building a list that reflects reality, not guesswork.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Score them</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A founder-friendly scoring model that actually works:
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li><strong>Beat fit (0–3):</strong> do they repeatedly cover this?</li>
    <li><strong>Format fit (0–3):</strong> do they write the kind of piece your angle is?</li>
    <li><strong>Recency (0–3):</strong> have they covered it in the last 90 days?</li>
    <li><strong>Reachability (0–3):</strong> can you clearly see how to contact them / do they accept pitches?</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Total out of 12. Anyone below 8 is optional, not core. This is how you prevent your list becoming a fantasy board.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Build your "core list"</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Pick the top 20–40. That's it. If you can't confidently pitch them, they're not core yet.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Step 6: Decide how you'll actually use the list</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A list is pointless unless it connects to a weekly rhythm. A simple founder rhythm is:
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>1 story angle per week</li>
    <li>10 journalists max pitched for that angle</li>
    <li>1 follow-up cycle</li>
    <li>track replies and coverage</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Cision's follow-up guidance includes data on how long some journalists want before a follow-up (often a couple of days), and it's another reminder that PR works better when you run it like a system instead of a panic burst.
  </p>

  <h2 id="decay" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">7. The decay problem: why media lists die faster than founders realise</h2>
  
  <img src="/assets/vogue-coffee-blanket.png" alt="Vogue magazine with coffee and blanket" class="float-left mr-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-40 md:w-48" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This is the quiet killer.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Even if you build a brilliant list, it starts dying immediately because:
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>journalists change roles</li>
    <li>editors reassign beats</li>
    <li>publications restructure</li>
    <li>story cycles change</li>
    <li>interest shifts</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    That's why "media list building" isn't a one-time task. It's maintenance. But the maintenance can be light if you design it correctly.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Here's the lowest-effort maintenance that keeps performance high:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>once a month, review your top 30 contacts</li>
    <li>check their last 5 articles</li>
    <li>if the output has drifted, downgrade them</li>
    <li>if someone new is writing exactly your lane, upgrade them</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 clear-both">
    This is also why journalists themselves talk about inbox overload and filtering. When writers are flooded, they don't have time to educate PR senders on fit. They just filter harder. The PR spam problem is real, and it makes relevance even more important, not less.
  </p>

  <h2 id="pitch-mechanics" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">8. How your list connects to subject lines, timing, and pitch length</h2>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A lot of founders get stuck thinking PR success is about writing the "perfect pitch." It isn't. The pitch is the last 10 percent. The list is the first 90 percent.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Subject lines work when your list is right</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Muck Rack's subject line research is clear: subject lines win when they're specific and signal a story angle, not an announcement. But you can't "subject line" your way out of bad fit. A good subject line to the wrong person still dies.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Pitch length works when your list is right</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Cision guidance on pitching different media formats includes an "ideal pitch length" in the 100–200 word range for some formats, plus strong rejection rates when pitches aren't relevant. Short doesn't mean weak. Short means you respect their time and you're confident in the fit.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Follow-ups work when your list is right</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Follow-ups feel scary when you're guessing. They feel normal when you're relevant. Cision's follow-up guidance suggests many journalists want a short window before a follow-up, and it also points out how time constraints block coverage even when interest exists, which is why list quality matters: you want to be the easy "yes," not another time sink.

  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Journalist name</li>
    <li>Publication</li>
    <li>Beat / topic lane</li>

    <li>Audience lane (operators, consumers, investors, etc.)</li>
    <li>Evidence lane (data, expert quotes, case studies)</li>
    <li>Last relevant article URL</li>
    <li>Last relevant article date</li>
    <li>Contact method (email / form / socials)</li>

    <li>Outcome (ignored / replied / call / covered)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This turns your list into a system, not a hoard.

  <img src="/assets/laptop-sofa-palms.png" alt="Working on laptop on sofa with palm plants" class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-2xl w-40 md:w-48" style="shape-outside: margin-box;" />
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Here's the honest truth: the best media list in the world still makes you guess sometimes because editorial demand is not always visible from the outside. That's the part that burns founders out: spending hours building a list, writing a pitch, sending it, and then staring at silence with no idea whether you were close or miles off.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Live journalist requests flip that dynamic completely, because the journalist has already told you what they're writing and what they need today. It collapses the two hardest parts of PR, relevance and timing, into one simple question: "Can I help with this?" Cision's research repeatedly shows how much journalists value useful, relevant content and sources, and request-driven PR is basically relevance served on a plate.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 clear-both">
    That's why ContactJournalists.com isn't "a bigger media database." It's a calmer way to do PR, because it pushes you toward demand instead of forcing you to manufacture attention. You still build your core list, because that compounds over time, but you stop living in the exhausting cycle of guessing what journalists might want this week.

  <h2 id="category" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">11. Media list building by category (why industry context changes everything)</h2>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    One of the most damaging myths in PR is the idea that a "good media list" is universal. It isn't. The structure of a strong media list stays consistent, relevance, recency, beat fit, but what constitutes relevance changes dramatically depending on the category you operate in. This is not subjective. It's driven by how journalism is organised, how editors commission stories, and how audiences consume different types of content. Founders who ignore this end up pitching perfectly reasonable stories to journalists who could never use them, then assume PR itself is broken.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">SaaS and B2B technology: insight beats innovation</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    In SaaS and B2B tech, founders overwhelmingly default to product-led narratives. New features, platform upgrades, AI integrations, roadmaps. Journalists, however, are rarely looking for "another tool" story unless it's attached to a much larger trend. Multiple journalism studies and newsroom interviews show that B2B and tech writers prioritise patterns, second-order effects, and operator insight, not launch announcements.
  </p>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Angles that consistently perform in SaaS are:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>behavioural shifts inside teams (burnout, AI misuse, tool overload)</li>
    <li>unexpected usage data that contradicts hype</li>
    <li>founder mistakes and reversals</li>
    <li>economic pressure changing buying behaviour</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Ecommerce and DTC: consumer behaviour, not products</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Ecommerce founders often assume journalists want to hear about products, collections, or growth milestones. In reality, ecommerce journalism is fundamentally about people's money, habits, and trust, not SKUs.
  </p>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Angles that work:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>changes in purchasing frequency</li>
    <li>returns and regret</li>
    <li>pricing psychology</li>
    <li>trust signals and reviews</li>
    <li>supply chain or fulfilment stress</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Health, wellness, and supplements: scepticism is the default</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Health and wellness is one of the most aggressively filtered beats in journalism. Journalists in this space are not neutral. They are trained to be sceptical, legally cautious, and evidence-driven.
  </p>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Angles that work tend to focus on:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>consumer confusion</li>
    <li>gaps between marketing and reality</li>
    <li>unintended consequences</li>
    <li>regulatory grey areas</li>
    <li>lived experience navigating health claims</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Apps, AI tools, and consumer tech: speed and saturation change the rules</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Consumer tech and AI coverage moves faster than almost any other beat, which means media lists in this category decay extremely quickly.
  </p>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Angles that work:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>"why people stopped using X"</li>
    <li>"how AI tools quietly change behaviour"</li>
    <li>"unexpected downsides founders didn't anticipate"</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">The meta lesson across all categories</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Across every category, the pattern is the same: media lists fail when they are built around identity, and succeed when they are built around output. Journalists are not their bios. They are their last 10 articles. If your media list does not reflect that reality, it will always underperform, regardless of how good your product is.
  </p>

  <h2 id="walkthrough" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">12. A 45-minute, founder-proof media list build walkthrough (no PR background required)</h2>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    This walkthrough assumes:
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>You are a founder or small team</li>
    <li>You do not have hours to "research media"</li>
    <li>You want a list that produces replies, not a pretty spreadsheet</li>
    <li>You are building one usable list, not a lifetime database</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>The goal at the end of 45 minutes is one tight, pitchable media list of 20–30 journalists you can confidently contact this month.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Minute 0–5: Lock the press lane</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Before you open Google, Twitter, or any tool, you must lock one press lane. Not "PR" or "media" or "coverage." One specific lane that answers:
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>What topic is this about?</li>
    <li>What type of story is this?</li>
    <li>Who is it for?</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Rule:</strong> If you can't describe your lane in one sentence, you are not ready to build a list yet.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Minute 5–15: Collect proof of coverage</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    You are not looking for journalists yet. You are looking for articles. Find 20–30 recent articles that feel like the kind of piece your story would sit beside naturally.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Minute 15–25: Extract journalists and identify real beats</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For each article, click the author name, open their author page, scan their last 10–15 pieces. Tag each journalist with primary topic lane, angle lane, and audience.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Minute 25–30: Score ruthlessly</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Use the scoring model (Beat fit + Format fit + Recency + Reachability, each 0–3). Anyone scoring 8 or above stays. Anyone below 8 moves to "optional" or gets cut.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Minute 30–35: Add "why them" notes</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    For each remaining journalist, add one line explaining why they are on the list. This prevents re-researching the same journalists every time.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Minute 35–40: Decide how this list will actually be used</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Decide one simple rule for the next month, for example: One story per week, max 10 journalists pitched per story, one follow-up cycle only.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Minute 40–45: Plug in live demand</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    The fastest way to remove guesswork is to pair your list with live journalist requests, where writers explicitly say what they are working on. That's where ContactJournalists.com fits in.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    <strong>What you should have after 45 minutes:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>A 20–30 person media list you can actually use</li>
    <li>Clear reasons why each journalist is on it</li>
    <li>Confidence that your story fits their output</li>
    <li>A workflow that doesn't eat your week</li>
    <li>A way to supplement with live demand when needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="final" class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Final thoughts, founder to founder</h2>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If you've ever built a media list and felt proud of it, only to get absolutely nothing back, you're not stupid and you're not bad at PR. You built the kind of list founders are told to build: big, impressive, publication-led, and static. But journalists don't work in a static world. They work in deadlines, limited attention, flooded inboxes, and constant editorial reshuffles, which is why research keeps circling back to the same core truth: relevance is the only thing that reliably cuts through.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    A media list that gets results is boring in the best way. It's a shortlist you can actually use. It's proof-based. It's maintained lightly. It's designed around what journalists publish, not what founders wish they published. It's tied to a rhythm you can sustain, so PR doesn't become background stress or another tab permanently open in your brain.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">
    If you want to do this the calm way, build your core list, keep it alive, and then let live opportunities carry the rest. That's exactly what ContactJournalists.com exists for: one dashboard, real requests, clear relevance, and a system that fits around building a business.
