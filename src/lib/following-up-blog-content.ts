    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-4">TL;DR (for exhausted founders who just want the truth)</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Following up is one of the most misunderstood parts of PR.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Not because it's complicated, but because we as founders attach far too much emotion to the silence and we take it personally. How many times throughout your day do you say to yourself, "What am I doing with my life and why is this so bloomin' difficult?" I was doing that too!
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      I spent literally seven years building, scaling, and eventually selling It Really Works Vitamins. PR worked for us, but following up was one of the biggest mental drains in the entire process.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Too soon feels pushy, too late felt pointless and no reply felt personal, even when it wasn't.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Most founders either follow up too aggressively because they're anxious, or they don't follow up at all because they don't want to be annoying. Both approaches completely slow you down.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This guide explains why following up matters, when it genuinely helps, when it quietly hurts, and how often to do it without second-guessing yourself every time you open your inbox.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      If PR has ever felt chaotic, scattered, or like something you should be doing but never quite get round to properly, this is exactly why I built <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">contactjournalists.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Instead of guessing, Googling bylines, or endlessly scrolling Twitter, you can see journalists actively requesting stories in your niche, reply instantly while the opportunity is still live, and avoid wasting hours pitching people who were never a fit.

          I'm Fortuna, founder of <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a>
        </p>

          Before this platform existed, I built a supplement company called It Really Works Vitamins from scratch. Bootstrapped with £7000 of my life savings - it was stressful, chaotic, and eventually successful enough to sell after seven intense years. (Seven seems to be my lucky number!)
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          Like most founders, I didn't start out thinking that much about PR - for me it was all about social media. Early growth came from Instagram and influencer marketing. We sent products, built creator relationships, got shared, and for a long time, it worked brilliantly.

      Here's a little picture of Sean Andrew Sanders, a Men's Health Cover star that I reached out to, showing off my supplements on his Insta :)

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Then (cue the sad music) the algorithm changed. For all of us.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Reach basically disappeared unless you paid. Ads got expensive very quickly, especially if, like me, you were trying to run them yourself or with a tiny team of freelancers. Margins got tighter and tighter. And before I really clocked it, platforms I didn't own were deciding how visible my business was allowed to be.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That's when PR stopped being a "nice to have" and turned into something I actually needed.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      We eventually landed features in Forbes, Men's Health, and Coach Magazine, but it took time. The Forbes feature in particular didn't happen until 2019, and it came after years of trial and error, plenty of ignored pitches, and more than a few follow-ups where I was honestly just hoping for the best.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This was the piece (and yes I KNOW I love sharing this, and if you've checked out any of our other guides you see it in every single article, I will never stop loving this Forbes feature):

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      And that article genuinely changed things. Retail conversations suddenly got easier. Credibility clicked into place. People who had previously ignored emails actually started replying.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      But it didn't come from one genius pitch. It came from slowly figuring out how journalists actually work, and realising that timing matters far more than being clever.

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Founders don't struggle with follow-ups because they're bad at PR.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      They struggle because silence really messes with your head.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      When you've spent years building a business, an unanswered pitch doesn't just sit there quietly. It lingers. You catch yourself replaying the email, rereading the subject line, wondering if that one sentence landed the wrong way. You rewrite it in your head while you're making a coffee or brushing your teeth, even though you know it's probably not that deep.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Journalists, meanwhile, are having a completely different experience.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      According to <a href="https://muckrack.com/state-of-journalism" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muck Rack's State of Journalism report</a>, journalists receive hundreds of pitches a week, often while working under shrinking deadlines and smaller teams.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Your pitch isn't being judged in isolation. It's just one message in an extremely crowded inbox.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That gap is where the unease comes from. As a founder, you're experiencing the silence very emotionally - which is only natural. As a journalist, they're dealing with it operationally. Once this clicks - follow-ups really start to feel a lot less personal.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-accent-blue/10 to-accent-violet/10 border border-accent-blue/30 rounded-2xl p-6 my-8">
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        If you've ever sat there wondering whether to follow up, chase, or just leave it alone, you're not doing PR wrong. You're just doing it without enough visibility.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
        That's why <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">contactjournalists.com</a> exists.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">What Silence From a Journalist Actually Means</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is where founders waste the most emotional energy.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Silence usually means something very boring:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>your email arrived during a deadline rush</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>it was skimmed, mentally bookmarked, then buried</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>the angle was good, but the article already ran</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-blue">→</span>
        <span>they liked it, but didn't need a source yet</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      The <a href="https://www.digitalnewsreport.org/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters Institute's research</a> into modern newsrooms shows how compressed publishing cycles have become, with journalists juggling more output, fewer resources, and tighter timelines.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      They're not carefully rejecting founders one by one. They're triaging.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4 font-semibold text-white">
      Once you really internalise that, following up stops feeling personal and starts feeling tactical.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Emotional vs Strategic Follow-Ups</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is where most PR advice quietly falls apart.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      An <strong class="text-white">emotional follow-up</strong> is driven by discomfort. It's sent because silence feels unbearable, not because it makes sense.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      A <strong class="text-white">strategic follow-up</strong> asks better questions:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-mint">•</span>
        <span>Is this journalist genuinely relevant?</span>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
        <span class="text-accent-mint">•</span>
        <span>Is the story still timely?</span>

      <li class="flex items-start gap-2">

        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          When I was running It Really Works Vitamins, most of my worst follow-ups came from exhaustion. I was running everything. PR felt important, but never calm. So I followed up to soothe my own anxiety, not because it improved the odds.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Once I started treating follow-ups as a strategic choice rather than an emotional reaction, PR became quieter and more effective.
        </p>

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This distinction also comes up repeatedly in <a href="/blog/how-to-find-the-right-reporter-for-your-story" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">How to Find the Right Reporter for Your Story</a>, because relevance reduces the need for follow-ups in the first place.

      Following up works best when relevance was right, but timing wasn't.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      You can have:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">

      ...and still miss the moment by a day or two.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That doesn't make the pitch bad. It means it arrived at the wrong time.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is why responding to journalists who are actively requesting sources feels completely different to cold pitching. When a journalist has already asked for help, you're not persuading them to care. You're helping them do their job.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That's also why founders who respond quickly to requests see higher success rates, something I break down in <a href="/blog/the-fastest-ways-to-get-press-coverage-without-an-agency" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">The Fastest Ways to Get Press Coverage Without an Agency</a>.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">When Following Up Actively Hurts</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Following up becomes counterproductive when it's being used to compensate for poor fit.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      No amount of persistence fixes the fundamentals. If you're pitching the wrong journalist, chasing a story that's no longer timely, or leading with an angle that serves your company instead of the reader, following up just draws more attention to the mismatch.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That's not a personal failure, it's a structural one.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Journalists are very open about this. Relevance is the biggest factor in whether a pitch gets traction at all, which is something that shows up clearly in reports like <a href="https://muckrack.com/state-of-journalism" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muck Rack's State of Journalism</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      It's also why journalism ethics bodies like the <a href="https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Society of Professional Journalists</a> emphasise beat relevance and audience value over brand promotion.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This exact pattern comes up again and again in <a href="/blog/11-mistakes-founders-make-when-pitching-journalists" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">11 Mistakes Founders Make When Pitching Journalists</a>, especially around relevance and timing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      When founders chase the wrong opportunity, it doesn't just waste time. It quietly reinforces the idea that PR is random or luck-based, when in reality it's neither. It's about fit, timing, and visibility.

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Most founders want a rule because they're exhausted from negotiating with themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Every follow-up decision feels like a small mental tax. Too soon feels pushy. Too late feels pointless. And without any real signal to work from, you end up second-guessing even sensible decisions.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4 font-semibold text-white">
      In practice, one follow-up is almost always enough.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      For email pitches, waiting <strong class="text-white">three to five working days</strong> is usually the sweet spot. It gives journalists time to work through their inbox without letting your pitch go completely cold. A second follow-up can make sense if the story is genuinely still relevant, but beyond that, you're rarely improving your chances. At that point, it's usually better to move on and focus your energy elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      <strong class="text-white">Journalist requests work very differently.</strong> When someone has explicitly asked for sources, a clear, timely response often does all the work for you. You're not interrupting their day or hoping they care, you're responding to an active need. In many cases, there's no reason to follow up at all because the journalist will either reply quickly or close the request once they've filled the piece.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This difference is well documented. Research from the <a href="https://www.digitalnewsreport.org/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters Institute</a> highlights how speed and workflow pressure shape newsroom decisions, especially around sourcing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Twitter operates under its own rules again, which is why <a href="/blog/how-to-pitch-journalists-on-twitter" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">How to Pitch to Journalists on Twitter</a> exists as a standalone guide rather than a footnote.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      The common thread here isn't the platform. It's visibility.

        When you can see journalists actively requesting sources, understand what they want, and reply instantly while the opportunity is still live, you stop agonising over follow-up timing altogether.

      A good follow-up does one thing only. It resurfaces the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      It doesn't apologise excessively. It doesn't re-explain the entire pitch. And it definitely doesn't add emotional pressure or urgency where there doesn't need to be any.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      The goal isn't to persuade. It's to bring the opportunity back into view, in case timing was the only thing that got in the way.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Something like this is more than enough:
    </p>

    <div class="bg-base-800/70 border border-white/20 rounded-2xl p-6 my-8 font-mono text-sm">

      If the timing works, they'll reply.

      If it doesn't, you've still protected the relationship and your own headspace.

        This is also where having a system really helps. When you're pitching and following up across multiple journalists, it's surprisingly easy to lose track of who you've contacted, when you last followed up, and what's still worth chasing.

      <strong class="text-white">Email gives you breathing room. Twitter doesn't.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      On Twitter, everything is compressed. Journalists are skimming quickly, often on their phones, and they're usually very explicit about what they want. Founders tend to struggle because they bring long-form email energy into a space that rewards brevity, restraint, and following instructions exactly.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      When Twitter pitches fall flat, it's rarely because the wording was technically wrong. It's almost always a tone mismatch. Too long. Too eager. Too much context when the journalist asked for one specific thing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Journalists themselves have been very open about this. Research and guidance from the <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2018/how-journalists-use-twitter/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poynter Institute</a> shows that journalists use Twitter primarily as a fast sourcing and scanning tool, not a place for full pitches or background-heavy explanations.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Email and Twitter are doing different jobs. Treat them as different tools, not interchangeable channels, and a lot of unnecessary frustration disappears.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Following Up After Coverage (The Bit Nobody Talks About)</h2>
    
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is one of the most overlooked parts of PR.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Founders put huge amounts of energy into getting coverage, and then once the article goes live, they go completely quiet. On to the next thing. On to the next fire. It's understandable, but it's also a missed opportunity.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      A short, thoughtful follow-up after coverage does a lot of quiet work in the background. It helps build rapport, it makes future pitches feel warmer and more familiar, and over time it turns a single feature into an actual relationship rather than a one-off win.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Journalists talk about this more than founders realise. <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2019/how-journalists-find-and-use-sources/" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poynter</a> has written about how much journalists value being easy to work with and remembered as a good source, not just a one-time quote.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That follow-up doesn't need to be clever or strategic. It can be as simple as a genuine thank you, a quick note saying the piece was useful or well-framed, or even sharing how it landed internally. The point isn't to pitch again immediately. It's to close the loop like a normal human.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This idea comes up again in a slightly different way in <a href="/blog/why-most-press-releases-fail-and-how-to-fix-yours" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">Why Most Press Releases Fail (And How to Fix Yours)</a>, where one-off announcements rarely compound unless there's an ongoing relationship behind them.

        Because you're not just sending pitches, you can keep track of who you've worked with, who's responded before, and who might be worth going back to when you have something genuinely relevant. That context makes post-coverage follow-ups feel natural instead of awkward.

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      The real issue isn't follow-ups.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4 font-semibold text-white">
      It's guessing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      When you don't know who's actually relevant, who's actively writing right now, or who's open to sources this week, every pitch feels like a small gamble. Every follow-up feels risky. And every silence starts to carry far more meaning than it should.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That's the environment where PR becomes exhausting.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      This is exactly the problem <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a> was built to solve.

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That shift alone changes how follow-ups feel. When you're responding to real demand rather than guessing interest, you don't need to chase nearly as much. You save hours every week, avoid pitching people who were never a fit, and stop second-guessing whether silence means anything at all.

        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          When I was building It Really Works Vitamins, PR felt like this constant background hum of stress that never quite went away.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          It wasn't dramatic. It was just always there.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          There were half-written drafts sitting in my inbox that I'd opened and closed a dozen times. Twitter open in another tab, even though I wasn't actively using it, just sort of… watching it. Checking emails more often than I wanted to admit. Wondering whether today was the day I should follow up, or whether doing nothing was actually the smarter move.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      None of it felt clear. It all felt slightly tense.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      What made it harder was that this wasn't theoretical. This wasn't "marketing". It was my business. I'd put years into it. So every unanswered pitch carried weight. Silence didn't feel neutral, it felt loaded. Follow-ups felt risky. And PR, as a whole, felt like something other founders seemed to understand instinctively while I was forever trying to decode the rules as I went along.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      For a long time, I assumed that meant I was bad at PR.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Looking back, I wasn't. I just didn't have enough visibility.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Once I really understood how journalists actually work, not the version we imagine as founders, but the reality of how fast they move, how much they juggle, and how little emotional weight they attach to any single pitch, everything started to slow down.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Silence stopped feeling like feedback.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Follow-ups stopped feeling like a gamble.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      PR stopped feeling like this dark art I had to mentally prepare myself for.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      The biggest shift for me was realising that most of the stress wasn't coming from writing, or even rejection. It was coming from guessing. Guessing who was relevant. Guessing whether the timing was right. Guessing what silence meant. And when you're already running a business, that kind of constant low-level uncertainty is exhausting.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Most founders I speak to aren't bad at PR. They care deeply about their business and they're trying to do the right thing. They're just attempting PR without enough context, without enough signal, and without a clear sense of where their energy is actually best spent.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      That's exactly why I built <a href="https://contactjournalists.com" class="text-accent-blue hover:underline">ContactJournalists.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      Not to "do PR for you", and not to promise magic results, but to remove the guesswork that makes PR feel heavier than it needs to be. To let you see who's actually asking for stories, who's relevant to what you do, and when it's genuinely worth showing up and replying.
    </p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
      When you have that visibility, PR stops feeling chaotic. It becomes something you can approach calmly, intentionally, and on your own terms.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">Why don't journalists reply even when my pitch feels relevant?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Usually timing, workload, or inbox volume. Silence rarely means rejection.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">Can following up hurt my chances?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Yes, if it's excessive, emotional, or trying to compensate for poor fit.

        <p class="text-slate-300">

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">Does ContactJournalists.com actually reduce follow-ups?</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300">
          Yes. When you reply instantly to live journalist requests that already match your niche, follow-ups often become unnecessary.
