Free Small Business P&L Template (Google Sheets + Excel)
Startup, Solopreneur & SaaS-Friendly | Founder-Made | Free Download
If you’re a founder, solopreneur or small business owner trying to keep your finances organised, you need a P&L template that works in real life: simple, clean, easy to update and made for people who don’t have time to wrestle with spreadsheets.
This free Profit & Loss Template (Google Sheets + Excel) is exactly that.
I built it because almost everything I create for founders has the same heartbeat — making life easier for the people who are doing everything alone.
That’s exactly why I’m building ContactJournalists.com.

What Is ContactJournalists.com?
ContactJournalists.com is a simple, founder-friendly platform that helps you get press without:
PR retainers


expensive databases


hours of Googling


feeling like you’re shouting into the void


It helps you:
find up-to-date journalist contact details


receive live alerts when journalists request expert comments


write strong, human, founder-specific pitches using AI


track who you’ve contacted and who opened your email


learn how to pitch your story in a way that doesn’t feel awkward or spammy

And while ContactJournalists.com is built to give you clarity with your visibility, this free P&L template gives you clarity with your money.
Both matter. Both shape the outcome of your business.

Quick Refresh: What Is a P&L?
A Profit & Loss Statement shows:
what your business earned


what it spent


whether you made a profit


how that changed month by month


It’s the simplest snapshot of your business health.
 It’s also the document every investor, buyer, lender and advisor asks for first.

Running a Business Means You’re Constantly Switching Hats
One minute you’re the marketing team.
 Then customer service.
 Then operations.
 Then branding.
 Then packaging.
 Then sales.
 Then tech support.
 Then accounts.
 Then the person quietly holding everything together because if you don’t, no one will.
And somewhere in that overwhelming, never-ending to-do list sits the task we all avoid:
Sort out my finances.
Most of us don’t start businesses because we enjoy spreadsheets.
 But understanding your numbers changes everything:
your confidence


your decisions


your peace of mind


your direction


That’s why I created this free Small Business P&L Template.
 It’s simple, clean, currency-agnostic and actually usable in daily founder life.

Why This Template Works (and Why Founders Love It)
Most online P&L templates feel like they were made by accountants for other accountants.
This one was created by a founder for other founders, which means:
you don’t need to be a spreadsheet expert


you won’t be hit with 200 irrelevant categories


you can update it in minutes


you won’t feel overwhelmed before you even begin


It’s literally just:
Revenue → COGS → Expenses → Monthly Profit
Simple. Clear. Calm.

Who This Template Is Perfect For
This P&L template is ideal if you are:
a first-time founder


a solopreneur juggling ten roles


a SaaS founder watching burn rate


an ecommerce store owner with seasonal spikes


a coach or creator with variable income


a service-based business with fluctuating revenue


a bootstrapped startup building slowly and steadily


If you want clarity without complexity, this template is for you.

A Founder Confession: Why I Find This Weirdly Therapeutic
At the end of each month, I sit down with tea, open this P&L and:
add every cost


add every bit of revenue


watch the totals update


take a breath


feel grounded again


There’s something cleansing about it.
 A ritual of honesty.
 A moment where everything becomes clear again.
When you know your numbers, nothing feels as chaotic.

The Long-Term Reason This Matters
One day, whether in two years or ten, you may consider:
selling your business


bringing on partners


raising investment


applying for grants


taking out a loan


proving traction


Beautifully clean P&L records make you look:
prepared


professional


credible


investable


exit-ready


Future you will be grateful.

How This Template Helps You Right Now
Using it once a month gives you instant clarity:
Are you truly profitable?


Which months outperform?


Are expenses creeping up quietly?


Did that marketing test work?


Is your idea financially sustainable?


When can you pay yourself more?


Where is money disappearing?


Clarity creates momentum.
 Momentum creates confidence.
 Confidence creates better decisions.
