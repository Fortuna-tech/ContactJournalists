Prompt for Replit:

You are an expert full stack developer working inside Replit.
Create a very simple admin dashboard for managing blog posts. I want it to be robust for long posts and never truncate the content.

Technical requirements:

Stack

Use Node.js with Express for the backend.

Use plain HTML, CSS, and a bit of vanilla JavaScript for the admin UI, no fancy frameworks needed.

Store posts in a SQLite database in the Replit project. Use a TEXT column for the post body so it can hold very long content.

Data model
Create a posts table with at least:

id (integer primary key)

title (text)

slug (text, unique)

content (TEXT, must support long blog posts)

created_at (datetime)

updated_at (datetime)

Backend routes
Implement these routes:

GET /admin
Serve the admin dashboard HTML page.

GET /admin/posts
Return JSON list of all posts with id, title, slug, and dates.

GET /admin/posts/:id
Return JSON for a single post so I can edit it in the UI.

POST /admin/posts
Create a new post. The request body has title, slug, and content.
Use express.json() with a high enough limit so long posts are not cut. For example:
app.use(express.json({ limit: "5mb" }))
Do not manually truncate the content anywhere.

PUT /admin/posts/:id
Update an existing post. Same fields as create. Also must not truncate text.

Admin page UI
Create a simple HTML admin page with:

A list of existing posts on the left.

A form on the right with:

Title input

Slug input

A large <textarea> for content that is full height of the page for comfortable writing.

Save button for creating or updating posts.

Behaviour:

When I click a post in the list, load it into the form for editing.

When I click Save, send a fetch request to the appropriate route (POST for new, PUT for existing).

After saving, show a small “Saved” message and refresh the list.

Important: do not cut my blog posts

Configure the body parser so it accepts large request bodies.

Use SQLite TEXT without any length limit in the schema.

Do not slice, substring, or trim the content except normal trim() on title and slug.

Test with a very long dummy blog post to confirm that the full text is stored and retrieved intact.

Simple password protection

Add a very basic password check to the admin routes.

Read a password from an environment variable ADMIN_PASSWORD.

For simplicity, use a prompt in the browser that asks for the password the first time, then store it in localStorage and send it as a header on each request, where the backend verifies it.

Project structure

index.js for the Express server and routes.

db.js for SQLite setup and migration.

public/admin.html, public/admin.js, public/admin.css for the admin UI.

Serve the admin assets from Express using express.static.

Please write all the code files, wire everything up so it runs on Replit with node index.js, and include setup instructions in a comment at the top of index.js explaining how to set ADMIN_PASSWORD and how to access the admin dashboard.
