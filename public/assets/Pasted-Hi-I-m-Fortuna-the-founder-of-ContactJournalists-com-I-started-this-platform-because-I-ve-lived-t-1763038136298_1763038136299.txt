Hi, I’m Fortuna, the founder of ContactJournalists.com.
I started this platform because I’ve lived the pain of trying to get press without a PR budget.
Back in 2015, I launched my own supplements brand. When I began looking for PR support, one well-known agency quoted me a £1,000 per month retainer — and that was the low end of the market. They couldn’t even promise they’d get me featured anywhere. It felt like a huge slap in the face.
So, I did it myself. I spent hours finding journalists, reading what they wrote, and reaching out one by one. It worked, but it was so exhausting!
Seven years later, after I sold that brand, I already knew what I wanted to build next. I’d seen the gap in the market. I knew this was a problem that needed solving and I was the woman to do it!
Fast forward to now, and here we are: ContactJournalists.com 
I’m active on Reddit and I’ve  been using it to collect real feedback from our beta users. Every update, every feature, every improvement comes from what solo devs, solopreneurs and small brand owners tell me they actually need.
ContactJournalists.com is built for anyone with a dream: whether you’re building a SaaS, running a beauty brand, launching an Etsy shop, or trying to get your story into Vogue, Men’s Health, The Guardian, or the blogs you love!
This platform exists because I’ve been where you are. I’ve done it the hard way, and I built the tool I wish I’d had back then.
From one small business owner to another, (who actually did her tiny brand into Men's Health Magazine) - you can do it 💪🏽
1. Introduction: That Morning You’ll Never Forget
Imagine waking up one morning, checking your phone, and your screen is going crazy.
Hundreds of notifications.
Stripe emails stacking up faster than you can swipe.
“New order.” “New order.” “New order.”
You just stare at it. Half-asleep. Half in shock.
Because three weeks ago, you were plodding along with one sale every few days and honestly you were absolutely thrilled. You even posted a little screenshot on Reddit like, “Got my first 4 customers!” and it felt massive.
But now it’s not even breakfast time and you’ve already made more in revenue than you did the whole of last month.
You open Google Analytics and your jaw just drops.

Traffic pouring in. All from American Men’s Health Magazine.
And the maddest part of all this is you didn’t even know it was coming. Two weeks earlier, you’d replied to a journalist request on ContactJournalists.com. The journalist never confirmed they’d seen it. No reply, no heads-up, nothing.
But here you are, in your pyjamas watching Stripe explode because someone, somewhere, decided to feature you.
That’s the power of getting in front of the right journalist at the right time. No ad spend. No influencer deal. No viral TikTok. Just one perfect story landing in the perfect inbox at exactly the right moment.
This is how small brands end up in massive publications out of nowhere (and this is actually what happened to me with my own supplement brand) 
It’s how you go from one sale a week to waking up to “New order. New order. New order.”
In this guide, I’ll be breaking down every platform that helps you make that happen. From HARO (Help a Reporter Out) and ResponseSource to MuckRack, Roxhill Media, and the new generation of AI-driven tools like my very own ContactJournalists.com.
Let’s dive in and figure out which one’s actually worth your time and hard-earned revenues. 
2. Why Finding the Right Contacts Matters More Than Ever
Ok so let’s step into the shoes of a journalist for a minute.
Imagine you’ve got three pieces to finish today, two more sitting half-written in drafts, and an editor pinging you for updates. You’re juggling deadlines, pitching your own freelance stories on the side, trying to keep up with what’s happening online, and somehow still remembering to eat lunch
Then your inbox pings.
Fifty new emails. Product launches. Press releases. Random pitches. Half of them completely irrelevant. Most will be ignored. A few will get opened. Maybe one will actually stand out.
Now imagine that one is yours.
The perfect subject line. The right tone. A story that fits exactly what they’re working on this week. You’ve just made their day easier, and in that moment, they like you for it. They click. They reply. A few hours later, your brand is part of a national feature.
That’s the moment everything changes.
Because once you’ve been featured in one publication, something shifts.
You suddenly have credibility. Real, hard-earned, Google-searchable credibility.
Other journalists will see it. Their competitors notice. The next time you pitch, you’re not just a random name in the inbox anymore. You’re that founder featured in Men’s Health. You’re that startup that got covered in The Guardian.
You know what you’re talking about now. You’ve got momentum. You’re going places.
That’s the power of connecting with the right journalist at the right time with precisely the right angle.
The key to precision is having access to the best, most up-to-date contact information and tools. Platforms that help you get your story in front of journalists who actually want to hear it. 
ContactJournalists.com
Journalists are working under huge pressure, juggling deadlines and story angles. What they want is something that makes sense for what they’re already writing about.
A  friend of a friend told me  about a small craft business that got shared on Stacey Solomon’s Instagram. One post. Within twenty-four hours, they’d brought in £18,000 in sales. No ads, no strategy, just genuine exposure from someone people trust! 
Press works the same way.
The right outreach platform helps you find journalists (as well as Influencers) covering your niche, see what they’ve written lately, and reach out with something that genuinely adds value.
It stops being guesswork. It starts being a detailed strategy! 
And when you nail that connection, when your timing, story, and angle line up, that’s when the magic happens! 
So, if getting that one article or influencer mention can change the entire trajectory of your business, it’s worth investing time into the tools that actually make it happen.
I ran my own unscientific vibe check - trawled through Reddit threads, industry reviews, and our own experiences to break down the platforms out there right now.
3. The Tools You Need to Get Featured in Magazines, Newspapers and Podcasts (and What They’re Really Like to Use)
Before we get into the list, it’s worth understanding which features really make a difference when picking a media outreach platform.
These are the three main things you’re going to need:
Get journalist alerts from journalists looking for a news story in your niche.
 Find the right journalist,
 Write a good pitch, and
 Track who you’ve contacted.
Here’s what to look for, and where each tool delivers:
Live alerts from Journalists: Why this is so valuable:


Journalists often operate on tight deadlines and fast-moving news cycles. A tool that sends you live alerts when a reporter says “I need sources on X topic” gives you a first-mover advantage.


Reaching the right journalist while the need is fresh means your pitch has a much higher chance of being used. For example, one article notes that journalists are far more likely to respond when the pitch taps into current events or trending topics. Cision+2Meltwater+2


According to PR and media-monitoring statistics: “55% of journalists get at least a quarter of the stories they publish from pitches.” Meltwater That means you’re not just sending into a black hole — but you need to be relevant, timely and targeted.


Live alerts help you stay on top of when a journalist is actively looking — rather than waiting for them to pick you. It turns “cold outreach” into “warm outreach”. 
ContactJournalists.com

Accurate, up-to-date contacts. The best platforms constantly refresh data and verify emails so your messages reach the right inbox.


Smart search filters. You should be able to search by topic, country, or publication. A skincare founder in Manchester doesn’t need a sports reporter in New York.


Ease of use. If you have to book a demo before you can even log in, take it from me - it’s already going to be expensive, complicated and not built for you.


Pitch tracking. You want to see who opened your email, who replied, and when to follow up.


Real value for money. (Warning: You may need to make yourself a cup of tea soon to calm your nerves - some of the tools I'm going to cover can cost as much as a small car. Others ( ie ContactJournalists.com) give you exactly what you need for an affordable monthly fee.





In summary: If you have a workflow that gives you accurate journalist contacts + smart filtering + easy usage + tracking + live alerts  AND you pay an affordable price - you’ll be set up to do PR outreach in a far smarter way. 
Now let me walk you through the main platforms, what they cost, and what it’s actually like to use them.

 Startup-friendly tools like PressRush, ResponseSource, and Prowly work immediately. Enterprise platforms are better if you have a dedicated PR team and budget.

How To Get Your Small Business Featured in Magazines, Blogs, and News Sites
Getting featured once is exciting  but learning how to get consistent press coverage is what grows your brand, your sales, and your credibility.
This is your guide to getting your business, product, or SaaS featured in magazines, blogs, and news sites — without a PR agency. Whether you’re building a fashion label, a beauty brand, a wellness startup, or a SaaS platform, this is exactly how to start generating the kind of press that makes people Google you.
All of these strategies come directly from founders using ContactJournalists.com, the affordable live alert system that connects small brands and startups directly with journalists who are already looking for stories.

1. Lead With the Story, Don’t Be Salesy!
The first rule of press coverage: journalists don’t care what you sell - journalists care why it matters.
When I ran my first startup brand, I stopped leading with product descriptions and started talking about the problem that my vitamin brand solved. That’s what finally got me featured.
What to include in your pitch:
How it ties into a current trend, conversation, or problem - THIS IS A BIG ONE - if you can have an angle on this it’s much more likely that your story will get featured!
Why you started your business (do you have a deeply personal or emotional angle?).


What makes it different or better for your audience? Again - what’s the problem you’re solving and why do you do it so much better than anyone else?



You don’t need to sound formal - journalists appreciate a clear, honest story that strikes a chord - and most importantly, stands out from the hundreds of other emails that the journalist receives each day.
2. Research the Right Journalists
Don’t  spray and pray with hundreds of cold emails! Find journalists who already write about niches and brands like yours.
Use tools like:
ContactJournalists.com – for live journalist alerts and verified media contacts.


MuckRack – for journalist portfolios and past articles.


ResponseSource – for UK press requests.


Search by topic or outlet. If you’re a SaaS founder, target TechCrunch or Business Insider.
 If you’re a fashion or beauty brand, focus on lifestyle editors at Vogue, Refinery29, or Marie Claire.
3. Keep Your Pitch Short, Smart, and Story-Driven
A good pitch reads like something they could copy and paste into their next article.
Structure:
One sentence on who you are.


Two sentences on what your brand does and why it matters.


One link to your website and social media.


A thank you and your name.


That’s it. No essays. No “hope you’re well” paragraphs.
If you’re responding to a journalist alert via ContactJournalists.com, reply within the first hour — speed really matters.

4. Make Your Brand Stand Out From the Crowd!
Every journalist’s inbox is full of brands shouting “pick me.”
 The way to stand out isn’t shouting louder - it’s being memorable.
Ask yourself: what small gesture could make your brand impossible to forget?
Try these thoughtful touches:
Send a small sample or mini gift that fits their beat (eco packaging for sustainability editors, a scented candle for lifestyle writers).


Add a handwritten thank-you note — short, warm, and authentic.


If you can, include a detail that shows you’ve done your research: “I read your feature on sustainable startups and thought this might fit your next roundup.”


I used to send handwritten notes with every sample when I ran my supplements brand. It sounds simple, but it worked — journalists remembered the human touch long after the email thread ended.

5. Know When (and How) to Follow Up
The follow-up is where most founders mess up. Too soon feels pushy; too late, and your email is buried.
A good rule:
Wait 5–7 days.


Reply to your original email (don’t start a new thread).


Keep it to one short line like, “Hi [Name], just checking whether this might be useful for any upcoming features. Thanks again for your time!”


Sometimes they won’t reply at all. That’s okay. Move on — and pitch another journalist the next day. Consistency wins.

6. Build a “Press Page” as Soon as You Can
Once you land your first mention — even if it’s just a small blog — display it proudly.
Add an “As Seen In” section on your homepage with logos of publications you’ve been featured in. Create a “Press” page with links, short quotes, and one professional image.
Journalists do background checks. When they see you’ve already been covered, it signals credibility.

7. Keep Pitching and Expanding
Getting featured in one magazine isn’t the end — it’s the start of momentum.
Once you’re featured:
Pitch to competitor publications (“We were recently featured in X and thought your readers might also love our story”).


Repurpose your story into blog content or LinkedIn posts.


Use each mention to build authority — link it in your email signature and product pages.


I did exactly that when I first got featured. The first small piece led to another, and suddenly I was being approached by blogs I hadn’t even emailed.

8. Track Everything
Keep a record of who you’ve pitched, when, and how they responded.
You can manage this inside ContactJournalists.com, or with a simple Google Sheet. Tracking saves time and helps you learn what kind of angles get the best results.

9. Stay Human
The best publicity comes from connection, not strategy.
 Be polite. Be patient. Be kind.
Every journalist is just a person on a deadline — help them, and they’ll help you.
Publicity isn’t luck. It’s rhythm, timing, and empathy.

Great call — let’s build out that section with real-life examples and YouTube videos you can embed, so it doesn’t feel generic or “AI-written.” We’ll keep it in your voice and still super actionable.

How To Write a Press Release That Actually Gets Read
Here’s the truth — most press releases get ignored. They’re too long, they sound like corporate boiler-plates, and they don’t give journalists anything they can use. But when you do it right, a press release can open doors, land features, and get your brand into the mags, blogs and news sites you dream of.
Everything here is based on what founders using ContactJournalists.com are doing right now — connecting directly with journalists and submitting story-ideas that get noticed.

1. Start With a Headline That Reads Like a Story
Journalists get hundreds of subject lines. If yours sounds like “Company X Announces…” they’ve probably moved on already.
 What works:
Headlines that look like news stories (“London startup turns packaging waste into home décor that actually looks good”)


Emotion or intrigue (“This founder ditched the 12-step skincare routine”)


Real language, not “we are pleased to announce…”
 When I was running my first brand, I changed my headline style and the number of replies jumped.


Video example:
How to Write a Press Release Step‑by‑Step (FREE Templates)

2. Nail the Opening Line
Your first line should answer: What’s the story? Who does it affect? Why now?
 Forget: “We are excited to announce…”
 Try:
“After years of helping founders spend thousands on PR, ContactJournalists.com launches a platform that gives affordable live journalist alerts and verified contacts.”
 Short, direct, and full of juice.
 Real world source for format and examples: See “Best Press Release Examples …” article. (PRLab | B2B Tech PR Agency)

3. Keep It Under ~400 Words
A press release is not a blog post.
 Include:
Who you are


What’s new or launching


Why it matters


Where to find you
 Leave out: 1,000-word mission statements.
 Case study reference: “How Press Releases Drive Results: 5 Real-World Case Studies.” (pressconnect.ai)



4. Add a Real Quote
Quotes show your brand’s voice and give a journalist something tangible to lift. Skip the generic.
Example quote you might use:
 “I started my first brand after being quoted £1,000/month by a PR agency who could not guarantee coverage. So I built ContactJournalists.com to give founders control back.”
 That kind of quote gets used.

5. Make It Easy to Copy-Paste
The easier you make a journalist’s job, the better your odds.
 Checklist:
Plain text (no weird fonts)


Links inline (website, socials, image folder)


Clear contact at the bottom (name, email, phone)


Short boilerplate (2-3 lines about your company)
 YouTube reference to show structure:


How to write a press release that actually results in news

6. Personalise Before You Send
Don’t send a mass blast.
 Check: what did the journalist last write? Reference it. One sentence like:
“Loved your feature on sustainable beauty brands — thought our new refill system would make a great follow-up.”
 That 30 seconds of personalising makes you memorable.

7. Stand Out From The Crowd (Thoughtfully)
Everyone sends emails. Few create a moment.
 Unique ideas:
Send a small, relevant gift (eco beauty brand → sample in recycled packaging)


Include a handwritten note (“Thanks for writing about indie makers — thought you might like this”)


Offer something useful (early beta access, exclusive quote, unique photo)
 When I ran my startup brand I actually did this: sent a handwritten note + product sample to a lifestyle editor. They replied. It worked.



8. Time It Right
Timing matters.
Ideal: Tuesday to Thursday, 9:30-11:30 am


Avoid: Friday afternoon or Monday morning (everyone’s catching up)
 If you’re doing a seasonal launch, pitch 6 weeks ahead.
 For small brands, even a local news piece with good timing can have big knock-on effects.



9. Follow-Up (But Don’t Be Pushy)
Most coverage fails because there’s zero follow-up.
 Good rule: Wait 4–5 days. Reply same thread. One line:
“Hi [Name], just checking if this might fit for an upcoming feature. Thanks again!”
 No reply? Move on. Flex your next angle.

10. Example Press Release Template
Headline: “The platform helping small businesses get press coverage — without PR agencies”
 Opening line:
ContactJournalists.com launches a new platform giving founders direct access to live journalist alerts and verified media contacts, making press affordable and accessible.
 Quote:
 “We built this after seeing founders pay thousands with no guarantees,” says Fortuna, founder of ContactJournalists.com.
 Boilerplate:
 ContactJournalists.com is a UK-based media outreach platform built for founders, solopreneurs and small brands. It offers live journalist alerts, verified contacts and AI pitch writing to help anyone land press coverage faster and more affordably.

How to Get Your Brand Featured in the Press (Without a PR Agency)
Running a small business means you wear every hat. You’re the marketing department, customer service lead, social media manager, accountant, operations person — sometimes all before lunch. And somewhere in between all that, you’re also meant to find time to get your brand in the press.
Whether you’re building a beauty brand, a SaaS, a supplement company or a fitness label, press coverage can completely change your trajectory. It gives you credibility, trust, and the kind of exposure no paid ad can buy. But PR agencies are expensive, and most of them can’t even promise results.
That’s exactly why I built ContactJournalists.com.
I know how it feels to be quoted a £1,000-a-month retainer by a big agency that “can’t guarantee” you’ll get featured. I know what it’s like to be working flat-out trying to keep customers happy, only to realise press outreach is yet another job on your endless list.
So I created something simple.
With ContactJournalists.com, you can:
Get live journalist alerts when reporters are looking for quotes or stories like yours.


Find verified journalist contacts instantly — no digging through old LinkedIn profiles.


Use our built-in AI pitch writer to help you sound natural, confident, and clear.


Reach out directly, without the agency middleman or the four-figure invoice.


If you’re a solopreneur, solo dev, or small brand owner, this platform was built for you. It’s the tool I wish I’d had when I was running my supplement brand and trying to do everything at once.
And right now, while we’re still in beta, it’s completely free for the first three months for the first 200 users.
Getting featured doesn’t have to feel out of reach. When you find journalists who already write about brands like yours, keep your pitch short and human, and stay consistent with your outreach, the opportunities start to build up.
Your story deserves to be told — and with a little persistence, it will be.
From one founder to another:
 Keep showing up. Keep telling your story. And let ContactJournalists.com make that part just a little bit easier.
