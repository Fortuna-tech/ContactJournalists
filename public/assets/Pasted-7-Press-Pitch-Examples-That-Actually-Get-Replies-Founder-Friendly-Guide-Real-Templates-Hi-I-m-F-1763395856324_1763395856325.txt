7 Press Pitch Examples That Actually Get Replies (Founder-Friendly Guide + Real Templates)
Hi, I’m Fortuna — the founder of ContactJournalists.com.
I built ContactJournalists.com after my own stressful, scattered attempts at getting publicity for my brand. If you’ve ever tried to do your own PR as a small founder, you’ll know exactly what I mean.
 Refreshing Twitter, scrolling endlessly, jumping between tools, hunting for journalist email addresses, and still missing brilliant opportunities because you heard about them too late.
 It’s chaotic and awful and you already have enough to do as a founder!
That’s why timing is everything in PR.
 You can write a great pitch, but if you send it when a journalist isn’t thinking about that topic, it just vanishes.
But when a journalist is actively asking for expert quotes, founder insight or a specific type of story — and you appear in their inbox at that exact moment…
 that’s when you cut through everyone else’s waffle and you’re the shining star in the journalist’s inbox!
That’s the whole idea behind ContactJournalists.com — helping founders catch opportunities as they happen, instead of hours (or days) too late.
This guide gives you 7 real, modern press pitch examples you can copy, personalised for what journalists actually respond to in 2025.
 Use them as they are or tweak them for your brand.
Let’s get into it.

⭐ Why These Pitch Examples Actually Work
Journalists reply to pitches that are:
short


relevant


timely


directly answering what they’re working on


human (NOT robotic or formal)


And most importantly:
 pitched at the right moment.
Every example below can be used reactively — meaning you can send it the moment you spot a journalist request through ContactJournalists.com.
That’s what gets replies.

⭐ Pitch Example 1: “Saw your request — here’s a quick quote you can use”
This is the easiest pitch in the world if you catch the request at the right time.
Subject: Quick quote for your piece on <topic>
Hi <Name>,
 Just saw your request pop up about <topic> and wanted to send something over straight away.
Here’s a short quote you can use:
 “<Insert crisp, clear insight. Make it useful, not fluffy.>”
If you'd like a slightly longer version or a different angle, happy to send it.
I’m the founder of <brand> — brief context in case it helps: <one line credibility>.
Thanks,
 <Your name>
Why journalists reply:
 You’ve saved them time and answered their request quickly.
 Reply rate is extremely high when timed correctly.
Perfect for: journalist alerts inside ContactJournalists.com.

⭐ Pitch Example 2: “I have a data point you’ll want for this”
Journalists love data because it makes their article stronger.

 I’ve got a stat that might help with your piece on <topic>.
In the last <X months>, we’ve seen:
 • <Interesting stat>

⭐ Pitch Example 4: “Happy to comment — here are 3 options”
When you reply to a journalist request, give them choice.
Subject: Comment options for your <topic> story

 Saw you’re looking for insight on <topic>. Here are three short options — feel free to use whichever fits:
1. “<insert quote>”

 It’s polite, quick, and no pressure — exactly how journalists prefer it.

⭐ A Quick Note on Timing (The Secret That Changes EVERYTHING)
You could copy and paste these pitches perfectly…
 but if the journalist isn’t looking for that story right now, your pitch will just sit there.
The founders who get the best results are the ones who respond in the moment a journalist is asking for something.
That’s why I created ContactJournalists.com — so founders can:
see journalist requests instantly


send the right pitch at the right moment


avoid refreshing Twitter every five minutes


never miss story opportunities again


Timing is half the battle.
 These pitch examples are the other half.
Put them together, and it’s a completely different PR experience.

⭐ Final Thoughts From Me to You
I’ve tried the long, complicated way of PR and it’s honestly exhausting.
 Founders don’t need more complexity — we need clarity, speed, and timing.
These pitch examples are designed to make your life easier.
 Use them reactively, follow the journalist’s lead, and keep things light and human.
And when you want to catch opportunities as they happen, have a look at ContactJournalists.com — it’s built specifically for founders like you and me.
